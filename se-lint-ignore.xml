			<code>s-081</code>
			<reason>This actually isn't a continued paragraph, based on indentations in the source material. In this story especially, Jack Keefe frequently starts sentences with lowercase letters and based on the scans, that appears to be what was done here.</reason>

			<code>t-029</code>
			<reason>Jack Keefe often starts sentences without an upper-case letter. All of these are intentional and match the scans.</reason>

			<reason>This is literally how it appears in the scans. Writing like this is consistent with Jack Keefe's characterization.</reason>

			<code>t-064</code>
			<reason>This is capitalized inconsistently. This suggests intentionality by the author and given Keefe's poor spellng and grammar, it would meaningfully alter Keefe's characterization to correct this.</reason>
