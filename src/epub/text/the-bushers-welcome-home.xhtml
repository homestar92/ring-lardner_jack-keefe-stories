				<p><b epub:type="z3998:salutation">Friend Al</b>: Well Al here we are in the Meadow Training ocean and this is the last day we will be on the Ship bord til we get to London Eng. and from now til we get a bord of the boat at London for <abbr epub:type="z3998:place">N.Y.</abbr> City we will all the wile be on land in Itly Rome Paris France and so 4th. Wear do in Naples tommorow and thats the 1st. place we stop at wile wear in Itly and we stay there 3 days with out playing no ball game so they wont be no chanct for me to find out if my scarab is going to bring me luck or not going to bring me no luck.</p>
				<p>Talking a bout my scarab and that reminds me what come off <abbr>yest</abbr> and last night and theys some stiffs a long on the trip that you couldent get them to stoop to low and that they isent nothing they wouldent do even steal and I ain’t found it out who done it yet or that is tride to do it but who ever was it would steal candy a way from a blind man wile there back was turned and when I find out who was it Im going to tell Comiskey and Callahan and they will see what kind of a gang of theifs they brot a long on the trip.</p>
				<p>I guess I told you a bout me geting a hold of that scarab in Cairo and it was a big bargun because the man that sold it to me wouldent of never gave it up only it wasent hisn and he was hard up and this is a genuwind scarab from the tume of Cops that was the cheif of Police in Cairo 4 thousend <abbr>yrs.</abbr> a go &amp; I give the man $7.50 for it and Steve Evans says its the gratest bargun a man ever got because 1 of these here scarabs if there genuwind gives you nothing but good luck and you cant have no bad luck as long is you carry them a round with you.</p>
				<p>Well <abbr>yest</abbr> <abbr class="time-of-day">p.m.</abbr> we was setting out on the porch I and Evans and Schaefer and a hole bunch of us and Schaefer halled some thing out of his pockit and it was a bout 10 of these here scarabs only of coarse not the real scarabs but fakes and some body ast him how much did he give for them and he says a nichol a peace and then he says to me Do you want to buy 1 of them off of me so as you will get some luck and I says No. I dont want no fake scarab because I got a real 1 and Schaefer says how much did you give for it and I says $7.50 and Schaefer says leave me see it a minut and I says Yes if you will promus to give it back right a way so he give me his promus and I halled out my scarab and showed it to them and they all says it was a dandy.</p>
				<p>Then Schaefer put my scarab in his hand a long with his fake scarabs and then he held his hand out and ast me to pick my scarab out and at 1st. they all of them looked pretty near a like and I dident know for a minut witch was mine but Evans says Cant you tell a real scarab from a fake and then he picked mine right out of the bunch with out no trubble and then he says You should ought to be a shamed of your self not knowing a real scarab from a fake and if you aint care full some body will get yours a way from you and you will be carring a fake a round in your pockit and wundring why dont you get some luck so I says How do you tell them a like and he says You cant tell by just looking with out a hole lot of practice but if you get a hold of them you can tell OK because you can bite on them and if its a real scarab it dont make no noise but if there a fake they sqeek like a rat.</p>
				<p>So then he give me my scarab and I bit on it and they wasent no noise of any kind. But Schaefer was jellus a bout me haveing a real 1 and him haveing a lot of fakes so he beggin talking like hisn was as good is mine so I says all right think so if you want to but wait and see witch 1 of us has the luck.</p>
				<p>Well Al when I come to bed last night I herd a noise like some body trying to get in to my birth room and at 1st I was going to jump up and open the door and smash who ever was it jaw and then I thot I better just lay there and leave them open the door and come in and then I would have them where they couldent get a way but they couldent open the door so pretty soon I dident hear no noise no more so I got up and went to the door and they was gone so this <abbr class="time-of-day">a.m.</abbr> I told Evans a bout it and he says it was probily some body after my scarab and if he was me he wouldent carry it a round with me but get the perser to stick it in the safe so now its in the safe and if some body steals it out of there the peopl that owns the boat will half to come acrost but I guess they wouldent of no body tride to steal my scarab if it wasent a real 1 and I ast Schaefer this <abbr class="time-of-day">a.m.</abbr> was they any body tride to steal hisn and he says no so that prooves whose got the real scarab and whose got the fakes.</p>
				<p>But it shows you what a fine gang we got a long on the trip and pertending like wear all pals to gather but the minut your backs turned they would steal your shirt and I guess some of these here pitchers would like to steal my fast ball but if they did they wouldent have nothing only a fast ball because they aint got nothing there self but I guess if they had my fast ball they wouldent need nothing else hey Al.</p>
				<p>Well Al we get to Naples tommorow night and I will male you this letter from there and they should ought to be some male waiting for me there from Florrie and little Al and of coarse I dont mean that little Al will be writeing me a letter but Florrie would know better then write me a letter and not say nothing a bout him and Im crazy to know how is he geting a long talking yet and how much does he weigh and so 4th and he should ought to have sevrel teeth by this time but I guess I shouldent be in no hurry for him to get a jaw full of teeth and that means all the sooner I would half to be buying stake for him.</p>

				<p>Well Al they wasent no male for me here not even a post card and I dont know weather little Als a live or dead and burred and how would you like to have a wife that dont never have time to write to you tho of coarse they wouldent be no sence in Bertha writeing to you when you dont never go a way no wheres or Bertha nether and besides you havent got no baby and Bertha wouldent have nothing to write a bout even if she went a way some wheres and set down to write you a letter.</p>
				<p>We got here <abbr>yest</abbr> and the 1st. thing when we land it they was a <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> come a round and exxamined us to see weather we had any thing and Evans says to him Dont waist your time exxamineing the pitchers because they aint none of them got nothing and he ment that we was all big helthy fellows tho of coarse they aint all of us that way and theys 1 or 2 of them that could take on a few lbs. with out crowding no body off of the bench. And then we was drove to the hotel and Callahan says we could go any wheres we wanted and I wanted to go up in my room and lay down but the boys says it wouldent be no fun going any wheres with out me so I had to go a long and we went and seen Pump A and Linoleum and <abbr>Mt.</abbr> Vesuvius and Evans says it was a good thing we got vaxinated up to japan so as we wouldent be in no danger if old Vesuvius had a erupsion and hes all ways pulling off stuff like that.</p>
				<p>This is Sun. and I dident go no wheres accept to see some of the mts. and runes we dident see <abbr>yest</abbr> and if they hadent of told me these was diffrunt I would of thot they was the same and Im glad it dident cost me nothing to see them and a little wile a go we was all called to gather and a wop give us a couple of bronx statues 1 for the giants and 1 for the White Sox and there statues of athaletes and the 1 the giants got is a left hander and it looks like he had just let lose of the ball and hes looking out to right field probily to see where the batters going to hit it and if hes like most of the left handers he will half to go and clime up on the right field fence if he wants to see the ball lite, and the 1 Comiskey got is an other athalete geting ready to throw a plate at some body and probily him and his <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> has had a quarl but you cant tell because the statue dont say nothing on it and both the statues is bear and not a stich of cloths on them and I guess theyd be bigger crowds come to the ball games if we drest like that hey Al tho theys all ways a pretty fare crowd out to the south side park in Chi when its my turn to work.</p>
				<p>I ment they wasent nothing wrote on the statues to tell you who they are but theys a motto wrote on them both and the mottos was wrote by Hal Cane and Evans says hes wrote a lot of grate books some of them pretty near as long is the Bibble.</p>
				<p>Well Al Comiskey wont half to keep his statue locked up in no safe because I wont try and steal it off of him and take it home because evry time we had <abbr>Co.</abbr> we would half to rap it up in a over coat or some thing.</p>

				<p><b epub:type="z3998:salutation">Old Pal</b>: Well Al they could of left this burg off of the skedule and I wouldent of made no holler and they should ought to call it rain insted of Rome and they dident give us no rooms with a bath in the hotel where wear stopping at but Schaefer says they dident bild no bath rms. in the hotels here because when the hotels was bilt all the peopl drest like them statues and when they wanted a bath all as they had to do was go out and stand on the side walk in the rain but now the police has made them ware cloths so they half to get a long with sparrow baths in the wash bold.</p>
				<p>Well Al Im so sick in tired of staying in the hotel and nothing to do that I couldent stand it laying a round here an other day and I would jump out the window or some thing but wear going to Niece tonight.</p>
				<p>May be thats a lifer place than this is and the sun shins onct in a wile.</p>
				<p>We could may be of played a game the day we got here 3 days a go because it wasent raining then but just geting ready to rain but the mare of the town says No base ball was to ruff and wouldent leave us play so Callahan and Mcgraw had to get out and show him what the games like and I guess he thot it was foot ball or some thing or may be he thot the pitcher shot the ball out of a canon and tride to hit the batter and I guess if he could see my fast ball when my supers good he would think the ball was shot out of a canon but any way when Mcgraw and Callahan explaned the game to him he seen they wasent nothing ruff a bout it so he says we could play the next day and then it beggin to rain and been raining ever sence and dont look like it was in no hurry to stop.</p>
				<p>So theys been nothing doing and no chanct to see if my scarabs going to bring me luck. Some of the boys has been out looking at more runes and wanted I should go a long but I told them I guest I could live a few <abbr>yrs.</abbr> with out seen no more runes and the day before <abbr>yest</abbr> they was all up calling on the pope &amp; wanted I should go a long but you had to ware your evening cloths and it just ment getting them soked and the boys that went has got some runes of there own to look at now I mean there evening cloths that they wore out in the rain. But I guess I should ought to of went a long at that because Evans says the pope ast where I was and Evans had to tell him I was sick and Evans says its bad enough to lie to any body let a lone the pope.</p>
				<p>Well Al I and Schaefer was talking a bout the rotten weather and Schaefer says he was talking a bout it with some of the peopl that lives here and they told him this was the worst rain sence the rain of Nearo and they use to have a lot worse rains then they have now and they got all the diffrunt rains named like the rain of Cesar the rain of August <abbr epub:type="z3998:surname">S.</abbr> and so 4th. and its a fine burg Al where they got so much rain that they half to name the diffrunt rains to tell them a part and if this burg was in the league theyd play on the home grounds a bout twict a yr. and on them 2 days theyd half to start a bout 1 a clock in the <abbr class="time-of-day">a.m.</abbr> to get in all the double headers and probily the grounds would be 5 or 6 <abbr>ft.</abbr> under water and take a little sod off like Bush or Schalk and theyd half to come up evry little wile and get some air and the outfielders would probily half to ride a round in boats and at that I bet I could take a mud skow and get a round as fast is some of them outfielders with out menshoning no bodys name.</p>
				<p>Well Al wear leaveing right after supper tonight and the sooner we get a way from here I will be tickeled to deth.</p>

				<p><b epub:type="z3998:salutation">Friend Al</b>: Well old Pal I guess the scarabs OK and I dident get stung when I bought it and its ½ payed for it self all ready and then some. They was a game this <abbr class="time-of-day">p.m.</abbr> the 1st. game we played sence we come a way from Cairo but it wasent in the game where I found out a bout the scarab being OK because Mcgraw wouldent leave me pitch the game because he is saveing me for the day after tommorow in Paris when they will be a big crowd. The giants got beat this <abbr class="time-of-day">p.m.</abbr> 10 to 9 and they wasent none of the pitchers had a thing and I could of went in there and throwed left hand it and give the both sides a triming but Mcgraw says he dident care nothing a bout this game and the 1st. game in Paris is the 1 he wants to win and thats why he kept me on the bench and wouldent take no chanct of wareing me out.</p>
				<p>But I was going to tell you a bout the scarab and what it done for me and heres what it done for me Al. We went over to monte Carlo a hole gang of us and thats the place where they run all them gamboling games faro and chuckle luck and the roll it wheel where you bet what coller the marbles going to drop in to or you can pick a No. and bet on that only of coarse theys so many Nos. that a mans a sucker to try and pick out any 1 No. but theys only 2 collers and you can bet weather its going to be black or red.</p>
				<p>Well Al before we start it out Evans ast me did I have my scarab a long and I says no so he made me go back and get it and I kept it in my pants pockit all the wile we was over there and they was a big crowd a round the diffrunt tables but I and Evans found a place and I dident make no bets for a wile and he made a few and dident win none of them because he was trying to pick out a No. so finely I layed down a $1 only they call it 5 franks here and in Itly it would be 5 liars and I layed it down on the red and sure enough up come the red and the cooper give me an other dollar so I says I was threw but Evans says I better try it again and bet the both of my $1 at onct but I wasent no sucker like that so I stuck a $1 in my pockit and bet the other $1 on the red and sure enough it come red again and the cooper had to give me an other $1.</p>
				<p>So Evans says now your playing with there money why dont you bet the hole $2 at onct so I seen where I wouldent be nothing out if I lost it so I bet the hole $2 on the red and sure enough it come up red so then I says Im threw and Evans says he wouldent never be threw as long is the luck was staying with me like that and he wanted I should play the hole $4.00 that Id all ready win on the red but I says no and wile we was argueing a bout it they throwed the marble again and it come up black so you see Al I would of lost the hole $4 if Id did what Evans wanted I should so I give him the laugh and I got up and left the table and he come with me and we went and found the other boys and they was all looseing there money as fast is they played it trying to pick out Nos. insted of collers so Evans told them what Id pulled off and Scott wanted me to sell the scarab to him and says he would give me $10.00 for it and I give him the laugh and now you see Al that the scarabs only costed me $3.50 insted of $7.50 because it win $4.00 for me playing roll it and after we come out of the place Evans says he over herd the prop. say that he was glad I wasent going to stay no longer because the way things was brakeing for me I would probily have all there money in a couple <abbr class="eoc">hrs.</abbr></p>
				<p>And Scott says 1 of the coopers ast him if I dident have some luck peace in my pockit because he never seen no body win 3 bets in suceshon before and Scott told him no that I was just born lucky because theys a rule against carring scarabs in there when your going to play the wheel and they would of tooken my money a way from me if they had of found out a bout me haveing a scarab but they wont get the money now because I got it right here and the scarabs hid a way where they couldent find it. O you little scarab hey Al.</p>
				<p>Theys a big <abbr>st.</abbr> carnval going on here and evry body drest up <abbr>yest</abbr> and parade it up and down the <abbr>sts.</abbr> in funny customs and we all put on our base ball sutes and road in the parade and I guess its a good thing Florrie wasent a round Al the way some of them girls over looked me and theys some fine looking girls a round here but of coarse I got a wife now and dont have nothing to do with no pretty girl.</p>
				<p>Well Al we go to Paris tommorow and I will may be write you a letter from there.</p>

				<p><b epub:type="z3998:salutation">Al</b>: Well Al this place is worse then Rome when it comes to rain and the 1st. day we was in Rome it dident rain but they hasent been no day like that here and they wasent no more chanct to play a game here then a man could fly you might say but it can rain all the rest of the winter and I wont have no holler comeing because I dont half to pitch no ball game now to find out weather my scarabs lucky because I found out now for sure Al and I dont mean a bout me wining that money at monte Carlo but I got an other big peace of news for you but probily you will see it in the Chi papers before you get this letter and may be you all ready know a bout it but theys a chanct that the federals wants to keep it a secrit for a wile and pull it just before the season opens up. So I will tell you a bout it Al and you can see for your self weather the scarab brot me luck.</p>
				<p>Well Al I wont be with the White Sox this comeing season but I will be with the federal and geting what Im worth and Comiskey and Callahan can jump in Mich. lake as far as Im conserned and the White Sox to and I will be pitching for the Chicago federal and I bet Comiskey will wisht he had of gave me real money when he finds out his pitching staff is all shot to peace is and probily ½ the peopl thats been going to the White Sox <abbr>pk.</abbr> will quite going there and come over where the federals plays there games and the federals is going after all the stars and they will get them to because they aint afrade to let lose of there money.</p>
				<p>Well Al I will tell you how it come off and I and Schaefer and Evans was setting in the hotel this <abbr class="time-of-day">a.m.</abbr> and Schaefer says Well boys we made a big miss take leaveing home this winter and Evans says how is that and Schaefer says the federals was sineing up all the stars that stayed home and giveing them grate big salerys and Cobb and Mathewson and Lajoie and Jackson and a hole lot others had all ready jump to the federal and probily we would of got them offers if we had of been where they could get a hold of us. So Evans says Well they could get a hold of us all right if they wanted to because they could wire us a telegram couldent they and Schaefer says Yes but may be there afrade that Callahan or Comiskey or Mcgraw would get a hold of the telegrams and not give them to us and then Evans says Thats right and I wouldent be supprised if some telegrams had all ready came for some of us and Comiskey and Mcgraw was holding them out on us so Schaefer says I bet thats the dope and Im going up and ast the clerk if they was any telegrams come for me that some body else got a hold of them.</p>
				<p>So Schaefer left us and went up to the dest and talked to the clerk a wile and pretty soon he come back and says nothing doing and we hadent set there more then 5 minuts after he come back when all of a sudden 1 of the bell hops come a round yelling my name and I ast him what was it and he says they was a cable for me only he says it in France and Evans had to tell me what was he saying so he give me the cable telegram and I couldent hardily open it Al because I thot sure it was from Florrie and may be little Al was sick or dead or some thing but after a wile I got it opened up and it wasent from Florrie a tall Al but Joe Tinker the <abbr>mgr.</abbr> of the Chi federal and it says Jack Keefe <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">St.</abbr> <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">Jas.</abbr> hotel Will give you ten thousend dollars per anum 3 yr. contrack to pitch for us cable the anser at onct and then it was sined Joe Tinker.</p>
				<p>Well Al you could of knock me down with a toy bloom only at 1st I thot it was a joke or some thing but then I seen it was wrote on the reglar paper like they all ways send telegrams on it so I seen it wasent no fake so I just set there and couldent say nothing and finely Evans says Whats the matter bad news and I says Well I wouldent hardily call it bad news and then I showed he and Schaefer the telegram and I thot theyd brake my arm off shakeing hands with me and pounding me on the back and Evans says You lucky stiff and I says How a bout that little scarab now and Evans says Yes and who got that scarab for you and you should ought to come acrost because if it hadent of been for me you wouldent of never saw the scarab so I says All right I aint no Sherlock and I will buy the ciggars for the both of you and Evans says Yes you should ought to buy a man 2 ciggars for geting you 10 thousend per anum so I says all right you cant call me no piker so I took them out and bought a couple ciggars for Evans and 1 for Schaefer and I wasent going to give Schaefer no 2 ciggars when he dident have nothing to do with me geting a hold of the scarab and he was lucky to get 1 ciggar.</p>
				<p>So then Evans says Well you better hurry up and anser the telegram or may be Tinker will change his mind and take the offer back so I ast them what to put in the anser and they says what I should put in it just Except your offer and will sine as soon is I get home and then they both of them wanted I should put some thing in a bout them and ast Tinker if he dident have no jobs for them so I stuck that in to and then I went in the telegram ofice and tride to send the telegram but they wouldent send it unlest I payed for it 1st. so I says how much is it and they says 31 cts a word and what do you think of that for a robbers game Al but they wasent no use makeing a holler because I couldent take no chanct of Tinker changeing his mind so I give them the money and it was $3.72 all to gather because I cut out the part a bout Evans and Schaefer because Tinker will let them know if he wants them and may be he dont want them and its none of my busness weather he wants them or not.</p>
				<p>So then I thot I better tell Callahan a bout it but Schaefer and Evans told me I better not because may be the federal might blow up before the season start it and then I wouldent have no job no wheres so I aint going to say nothing to ether he or Comiskey for a wile tho I guess they aint no chanct of the federal blown up when they got all them stars sined up and all that money to spend hey Al and I hope Tinkers got Cobb sined up for his club and I guess that wouldent be some comebination hey Al with Cobb geting the runs and me makeing the other club look like a sucker and I guess Cobb would be tickeled to deth to be on the same club with me because then he wouldent never half to hit against me accept in practice onct in a wile and I can make him look like a sucker on my curve ball any time he steps up there. Well Al if Tinkers got Cobb we will go threw that federal league like soup threw a sift and it will be a shame to take the money. O you 10 thousend per anum.</p>
				<p>Well Al thats the bigest news I got to tell you and if it aint in the papers youll be the 1st. 1 to know a bout it out side of I and Tinker and Evans and Schaefer because I aint going to tell Florrie nothing a bout it til we get home and then I will spring it on her for a supprise. Some supprise party hey Al.</p>
				<p>Well the boys has all been a round Paris seen the sites and theys plenty to see but Im all tired out with it all ready and cant hardily wait til we get to London and get on the bord of the Ship for home and I guess I wont only pitch 1 more game on the trip and that will be in London and may be that will be the last time I ever pitch with Callahan looking at me but its his own falt him and Comiskey and if they had of gave me a real salery in the 1st. place I wouldent half to jump to the federal to get the money.</p>
				<p>Well Al we seen all they was to see a round here and seen the place where Lajoies grate granfathers burred and the diffrunt liberys and gallerys and so 4th. and Im glad Florrie dident come a long on the trip because the wommen in the party has been spending all there time in the diffrunt stores buying hats and cloths and some of them will have enough diffrunt cloths so as they can ware a diffrunt dress out to the ball <abbr>pk.</abbr> evry day and go home and change between the 2 games when theys a double header. And we was gave a dinner party by a man that makes champlain wine and of coarse they was nothing to do but I must write 1 of them pones of mine and talk it off at the party and heres what I give them Al:</p>

				<p><b epub:type="z3998:salutation">Al</b>: Well Al it takes more then a scarab for a man to be lucky is some of these lucky stiffs and some of them must of been born with a silver horse shoe in there mouth the lucky stiffs and all as they half to do is throw there bat at a ball and make base hits when they got there eyes shut and if I was as lucky is some of them stiffs I would quite playing ball and buy stock in 1 of these here gold minds and theyd probily find dimonds and insted of them finding gold theyd probily find dimonds or some thing.</p>
				<p>Well Al I guess Ive pitched my last game for Callahan and of coarse I wasent pitching for Callahan but Mcgraw but I wont do no more pitching where Callahans watching me because I will be in the federal as soon is we get home where he cant see me no more and I would of gave a $100.00 to of win this game on <abbr>acct.</abbr> of it being the last game I pitched with Callahan watching me but I guess he seen that they was lucky to beat me and a man cant win no game no matter how much stuff you got when your working against a club thats so lucky that if they got a hold of some stock in a gold mind some wheres theyd probily be dimonds insted of gold.</p>
				<p>This here Daly should ought to start a black Smith shop with them horse shoes hes got and the White Sox sined him for a catcher but hes been playing 1 base on this trip on <abbr>acct.</abbr> of Callahan not haveing no reglar 1 base man a long on the trip so Daly was lucky to be in the game let a lone brake it up with a base hit and as soon is we get home youll read a bout him geting sent back to the new Eng. league and Im glad I dont half to pitch in that league if there all as lucky is him.</p>
				<p>Well old pal I wasent feeling nothing like my self any way and how could a man feel right when you been laying a round this burg 3 or 4 days and the air damp and fogy all the wile and <abbr>yest</abbr> was the 1st. time we seen the sun sence we got here so my arm was lame and stiff and I wouldent of never went in there only king Geo. the king of Eng. and the Lord mare of London and all the other High puloy was out to the game and Mcgraw dident dast pitch no body else only me on <abbr>acct.</abbr> of them peopl being out to the game and expected to see the best we had to show them. So when Mcgraw says I was to work I dident say nothing back a bout me not feeling good so before the game he dident know nothing a bout how bad I felt but if he was any kind of a <abbr>mgr.</abbr> he would of saw the minut I went in there that I wasent right and tooken me out. Or may be he seen they was something the matter with me but was afrade to take me out on <abbr>acct.</abbr> of may be the peopl that come to the game would make a holler.</p>
				<p>Well any way I went in there and the ball felt like it wade a 100 <abbr>lbs.</abbr> and I couldent do nothing with it and couldent hardily raze my arm a bove my solder and evry ball I throwed pretty near killed me but I wasent going to say nothing as long is Mcgraw insist it I should pitch so I stuck it out and I would of beat them at that if theyd been some body behind me besides a bunch of lofers that all there thinking a bout is get home and win an other penant in the <abbr>Nat.</abbr> league and get the loosers share of the serious money and they should ought to thank them self that there in the <abbr>Nat.</abbr> league and if they was in the american league they would be giveing the <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">st.</abbr> Louis. club and the yankees a tuft battle.</p>
				<p>Well they played like a bunch of these here collige willy boys and they should ought to of murdered what Benz was sloping up there but they act it like they was a scarred may be they would hit a hard foul and the ball would go threw the scream and hurt king <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">Geo.</abbr> and they would get arested for a trader so when we come up to the 10 ining the score was tide 4 and 4 and 2 out and up come this here lucky busher Daly and I was waisting my curve ball right a long on <abbr>acct.</abbr> I couldent get no brake to it because the ball was heavy and logy so I waisted a curve ball on him and he throwed his bat at it and catched it just right and made a home run off of it and that wounded the game up and we was licked and all the willy boys in the grand stand claped there hands and made Daly think he was a grate guy when he should ought to of been arested for ever swinging at the ball and pretty soon he will be throwing his bat at waist balls in the new Eng. league where he bellongs and the scout that picked him up must be sore at Comiskey.</p>
				<p>Well Al they was a grate crowd out to the game and I guess we showed them we got a better game then there baby game crickit only of coarse they dident see me at my best and I would like to pitch a game for them when my old super was in shape but at that they wouldent know weather a man was good or weather he was not good and they certunly got funny idears a bout base ball and before the game wile the boys was haveing there fielding practice Evans run a bout 10 <abbr>ft.</abbr> and catched a fly ball and evry body beggin claping there hands and yelling so I says to mike Donlin on the bench What are they holling a bout and he says That catch and I says what was they in that catch and he says they aint use to seen a fly ball catched because when theys a fly ball hit in there crickit games there fielders is lucky if the ball dont come down on top of there head but 1 time a bout a yr. a go 1 of there crickit fielders catched a fly ball and the king declaired a leagul hollow day. So you see what kind of a game crickit is Al a baby game and I would of win that bet off them crickit players in australia if they hadent of made up there own rules and robed me out of the money.</p>
				<p>Well Al we was just going to start the game and I was anounced to pitch and evry body beggin claping there hands and all standing up and Evans says Take off your hat so I took off my hat and bowed to them and Evans says what are you bowing for and I says Because there giveing me a hand and he says You got a grate lot of nerve because the reason there all standing up and got there hats off is because the kings just came and I told you to take your hat off because you wouldent of knowed enough if I hadent of told you and I says I guess I know enough all right and I dont half to ast you how to act or take no lessons from you and he dident say nothing back so I ast him witch was the king and he point it out a man that wasent no more king then you are Al.</p>
				<p>So Evans wasent as smart is he thot he was and the man he point it out was may be the Lord mare or some body but who ever he was he wasent no king Geo. because he drest just like I or you and a derby hat and hadent shaved for a <abbr>wk.</abbr> But the king was there some wheres all right because all the papers come out today and says he was there and probily hes got a privut box some wheres where they cant none of the bugs go up and bother him and ast him this in that and pester the life out of him and the papers says they was a bout 20 thousend peopl to the game and 1 of them says theys been 5 times that many out to some of the crickit and foot ball games and ether the reporter was full of hops or else they must be a fine bunch of rummys in this burg or else they dont charge nothing to get in to there crickit and foot ball games and they certunly shouldent ought to and it would be like as if a man had to pay to set in the livry staple and watch them hitch up a horse.</p>
				<p>Well Al I guess I shouldent ought to make no holler a bout my luck or find falt with the scarab after me geting that swell offer from the federal and whats the diffrunts weather I loose a ball game when it dont count nothing and a crowd watching you that thinks a man must be a star if he dont trip up and fall on his ear evry time theys a fly ball hit so I guess I shouldent ought to make no holler but I will be tickeled to deth when we get a way from here and on the Ship bord going home and we leave tommorow <abbr class="time-of-day">a.m.</abbr> for the Liver pool where the boat leaves from and this time wear going acrost a diffrunt Ocean from the 1 we went acrost when we start it out on the trip and this is the atlantic Ocean and it dont only take 6 days to go acrost and I will be home with Florrie and little Al in a little over a <abbr>wk.</abbr> now and the White Sox that is the boys that dident make the trip is all ready out to Calif. on the training trip and Callahan thinks I will be going a long with him to Calif. as soon is we get to Chi but I will give him a big supprise Al and I guess I will try and get Tinker to leave me stay home a <abbr>wk.</abbr> or 2 insted of going south to where ever the federals is at right a way and I guess Tinker will leave me do pretty near any thing I want to on <abbr>acct.</abbr> of how glad he will be to have me on the club.</p>
				<p>Well Al we been runing a round seen all the sites West <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Abie and the cort house and all the rest of it and beef stake diners and so 4th. til wear sick in tired and that old boat cant go to fast to sute me and of coarse I wont write you nothing on the Ship bord because you wouldent no sooner get the letter then we will be back in Chi a bout the same time but may be I will write you a letter from <abbr epub:type="z3998:place">N.Y.</abbr> city if I have time.

				<p><b epub:type="z3998:salutation">Old Pal</b>: Well Al Ive sprang it on Comiskey a bout me going with the federal and he pertended like he dident care and says he hopped I would have good luck and thats what they all say Al but you can bet he feels bad a bout it and would meet the figger of my federal contrack if Id give him a chanct but nothing doing Al because I want to be in the league where Cobb and them is in it and we will get the peopl wile the rest of them wont have no more peopl out to there grounds then if it was <abbr class="time-of-day">a.m.</abbr> practice. But the federals has been keeping things quite and they aint no body a round here knows a bout Cobb and Mathewson and Johnson and them jumping to the federal and it will come like a big supprise when they spring it and I wouldent be supprised if the american and <abbr>Nat.</abbr> leagues busted up when they hear a bout it. They might just as well Al is try and go a long with the bunch of bushers theyll have left when the federal gets threw with them.</p>
				<p>Well Al I sprang it on Comiskey up to the banquit tonight and the banquit was gave for us by the <abbr epub:type="z3998:place">N.Y.</abbr> fans and a crowd of Chi fans come all the way down here to meet us and they was at the banquit and there going to give an other banquit for us when we get to Chi and I called Comiskey to 1 side just before we went in to the banquit and I says Well <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Comiskey I got a big supprise for you and he says What is it are you going to beggin useing your head and I says No and he says well speak up.</p>
				<p>So I told him a bout me getting a offer from the federal in Paris and he says well did you except it and I says yes and, he says Why dident you give us a chanct to meet it and I says I dident think he would want to meet it because it was 10 thousend dollars per anum and he says Well thats onet you guest right and when did your bughouse friend buy a franchize in the federal and I says I dont know nothing a bout that but Im going to play with the Chicago federal and he says what a bout the contrack you sined up with me and I says You cant expect me to play for no $2400.00 dollars when I can get five times is much and he says All right go to the federal and good luck so I says Im sorry to leave you in the hole and he says Never mind I guess I can sell my ball <abbr>pk.</abbr> and live on the procedes.</p>
				<p>So I says Will you tell Callahan and he says Why dont you tell him your self and I says I dident want to spoil the trip for him so then Comiskey says Well we wont nether 1 of us tell him and may be he will find it out for him self a long a bout the 4th of July when wear playing st Louis a double header so I ast Comiskey to shake hands to show they wasent no hard feeling on my part and then we went in and set down to the banquit and I watched him pretty clost Al and he dident in joy nothing that came off and you cant blame him and I felt bad a bout it my self but a mans got to look out for your self in this game and cant let no sentimunt enter fear with you geting the money but you cant help feeling bad when your leaveing a club in the hole and Comiskey and Callahans been figgering on a penant winner all winter and now look at them and you can bet that Comiskey will tell Callahan a bout me and not leave him to find it out for him self the 4th. of July or no other time because they will half to go and get some body to take my place or that is try to. Fine chanct hey Al.</p>
				<p>Well Al I cant hardily wait til tommorow <abbr class="time-of-day">a.m.</abbr> and we get on the train for home and its after mid night now but I cant sleep on <abbr>acct.</abbr> of Im all exited up a bout geting home and seen little Al and Florrie again and I hope Allens tooken his wife a long to Calif. with him so as I and Florrie and little Al can have a little peace to our self wile Im home and I bet little Als talking by this time and cute as they make them and got a jaw full of teeth but may be he wont know me from a rabbit Al but he will know me before I get threw with him and after this he will remmember who I am because hes old enough now to know some thing and pretty near 9 <abbr>mos.</abbr> old. I wisht you could be there when he sees me Al and see how he acts when he sees his daddy and I bet he wont cry because I will make some of them comical faces at him and make him laugh even if he dont know who I am.</p>
				<p>They was some exitemunt the last part of the trip on the boat Al and I put some thing over on these here smart alex <abbr>gov.</abbr> employs and when ever a boat comes in they get on the bord of it and serch evry body to see if there smugleing dimonds or perls or any thing valueble that they bought in farm countrys so of coarse if they find them things on you you got to pay your duty on them and I wouldent of knew any thing a bout it only Evans tiped me off and says I better hide that scarab or they would soke me good in plenty and I says I will keep it in my pockit and he says they will serch all threw your pockits so I says where shell I hide it then and he says Take a big chew and put the scarab in the chew and keep it in side your mouth.</p>
				<p>So thats what I done Al and they dident never suspeck nothing and some of the rest of the gang had to come acrost and pay their duty on some of that junk they throwed there money a way on it in Cairo and japan and it dident cost me a nichol and all the wile I had some thing worth more then any of them but I come near chokeing to deth before it was all over and Demon Runyon a reporter for a <abbr epub:type="z3998:place">N.Y.</abbr> paper that met with us in Paris and made the rest of the trip from there the rest of the way a long with us says if he had of been the <abbr>gov.</abbr> employ that examuned me he would of put on a brown sute of cloths before he ast me any qestions.</p>
				<p>Them fans from Chi charted a lunch and came out to meet us and the Pres. of the Boston club come out and sined Speaker up because the federal was after him and I dont know how much is the Boston club going to give him but it wont be no 10 thousend per anum and I bet he will wisht he hadent of been in such a hurry to sine up when he hears a bout I and Cobb and them.</p>
				<p>Well they was a big parade down to the Doc to meet us and took us to the hotel and gave us a grate well come and evry body was glad to see us back safe again and we was glad to be back in the old <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism z3998:place">U.S.A.</abbr> where you dont half to lern no new farm languige evry 2 or 3 days and keep geting your money changed to liars and plasters and so 4th. As soon is we got to the hotel Schaefer called me to 1 side and says I must be sure and have a little poultry fixed up for the banquit so I went to my room and fixed up some thing for them Al to talk off at the banquit and heres what I give them and I wisht you could of herd them clap:</p>

				</header>
				<p><b epub:type="z3998:salutation">Friend Al</b>: Well Al this will be a big supprise to you Al and I bet you couldent never guess what it is so I will tell you. Im going a long with Callahan and the boys to Calif. tonight and we will get there Sat. or Sun. and join the boys that of been out there geting in shape sence last <abbr>mo.</abbr> and Im not going with the federal after all Al but made up my mind to stay with the White Sox. And that aint all the supprise Al and heres the rest of it Florrie and little Als out in Calif. to and they went a long with Allen and his wife when the rest of the club went last <abbr>mo.</abbr> and Florrie and little Als going to be there to meet me and will make the rest of the trip with me til its time to start back east and then I will send them strate threw wile I stay with the 1st. team for the exhibition games or may be I can get Callahan to leave me come strate back with my famly.</p>
				<p>Well Al I guess this is a big supprise to you and it come like a big supprise to me to I mean a bout Florrie and little Al being in Calif. and at 1st. I was so sore I couldent hardily talk but Florrie showed me in her note where it was the best thing to do and insted of me not haveing no time to get aquanted with her and little Al like if she had of stayed home and been here when I come we will have pretty near 2 or 3 <abbr>wks.</abbr> to gather because she will be on the training trip a long with me and of coarse she dident know nothing a bout me haveing that offer from the federal or she would of stayed here and I would of probily tooken her and little Al to Skreevport where the federals is at.</p>
				<p>Well we got in <abbr>yest</abbr> <abbr class="time-of-day">a.m.</abbr> and I was dissapoint it a bout Florrie not being down to the train to meet me but I went home and rung the bell to the flat and I seen the male box was full of male and bills and so 4th. and no body ansered the bell and opened up the front door for me and I was going to bust my way in because I thot they must be murdered or some thing but finely the womman on the 1st. floor come out and seen me and ast who was I and I told her and then she give me Florries note.</p>
				<p>Well Al when I opened it up and seen she was in Calif. and not home I set down on the steps and blubbered and couldent read no more of her note but finely I read threw the rest of it and come to the part where she says she was doing it so as I and she and little Al wouldent half to be suppurated again so soon and then I seen what a miss take I made not telling her I was going with the federal and the rest of the letter told a bout how Allen had loned her the money to go to Calif. and I would half to pay him back the 1st. pay day but I should ought to be dirty with money then because I certunly hadent throwed none a way all winter on my own fam but may be I might of spent a lot of money buying candy and beer for them farm qeens and princes.</p>
				<p>And down to the bottun of the letter she says the lady on the 1st. floor had the key to the flat and I could get in and leave some of my bagige but to not get the flat all must up and dirty and then she says an other reason why she had made up her mind to make the trip was on <abbr>acct.</abbr> of little Al and he was looking kind a peak it and the <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> had told her that he was probily lonesum for his daddy and a change of seen would do him good.</p>
				<p>Well Al for a minut I dident know what to do next but finely I thot I might is well go in and get rid of some of my bagige and see what kind of a place we was liveing in so I got the key from the lady and went in. Well Al they wasent no danger of me geting the place dirty because they was enough dirt there if a man wanted to plant corn and theyd left 1 of the lights burning and you can bet your life that Allen will pay for that and not I and Florrie and thats just what you might expect from a left hander to go a way to Calif. and leave the lights burning and I supose he was afrade it would be to dark for the roachs to read by hey Al.</p>
				<p>Well I finely brushed some of the dirt off the phone and I was going to call up the federal and see what did they want me to do but it was 1 of these here nichol 1st. phones and I dident have no nichol so I had to go clear down to the <abbr>cor.</abbr> of 35th. <abbr>st.</abbr> and get a ¼ changed and I took a big shot wile I was down there and I guess I had it comeing hey Al.</p>
				<p>So then I went back and called up the federal and of coarse Tinker was down south with the club and Weegman that owns the club was down there to and finely I got a hold of Gilmore the <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">pres.</abbr> of the league and told him who I was and ast him if Tinker had left any orders and he says no and dident act like he knowed any thing a bout me excepting the offer so I finely ast him would he wire to Tinker for me and find out what he wanted I should do and he says he would and I give him my phone No. and that was a bout 1 a clock and I dident hear nothing up to 3 a clock so I road down town and went up and seen Gilmore and he says he hadent herd nothing from Tinker but would call him up long distance for me so he got Tinker clear down to Skreevport.</p>
				<p>And then I talked to Tinker and he says who made you a offer and I says you made me a offer wile we was in Paris and he says some body was kiding you. He says I got your cable telegram excepting the offer so evry things OK accept that we dident make you no offer and aint going to make you none because your sined up. So then I seen what kind of a gang they was Al makeing a man a offer and then line out of it so I says is that so and hung up the receiver and Gilmore ast me what was the matter and I says they wasent nothing the matter with me but I would starv to deth before I would play in a league where they make a man an offer and then try and crall out of it so I come out of his ofice and slamed the door.</p>
				<p>What do you think of a league that trys to pull that kind of stuff and I guess Im lucky I changed my mind and come to find out they was line when they says they had Cobb and Mathewson and them and they havent got no body Al and I wouldent play in there league now for 10 thousend or ½ that <abbr class="eoc">amt.</abbr></p>
				<p>So after I come out of Gilmores ofice I called up Comiskeys ofice and he was down town so they wasent nothing fer me to do but hang a round til it was time for the banquit that the Chi fans give us and as soon is Comiskey showed up there I called him to 1 side and told him and says I changed my mind and Im going to stick with your club and Callahan was standing a little ways a way from us so Comiskey hollered to him and says Cal our young friend here is going to stick with us so you wont half to get Johnson so you see Al they was going to try and get Walter Johnson if I hadent of changed my mind a bout going to the federal.</p>
				<p>Well Al we had some banquit last night and now Im resting up and we start for Calif. tonight I and Callahan and Weaver and Scott and Benz and this here Daly and Slight and in 3 or 4 days I will see Florrie and little Al and wont half to say good by to them right after I see them like I would of if theyd of stayed here only of coarse I would probily of tooken them a long with us if Florrie really wanted to go. Well Al I wont get no 10 thousend per anum but insted of that I will get what I been geting and besides I will half to pay for Florries fair back and 4th. to Calif. and back and what ever else she has ran up on me but I guess Im lucky I dident fall for no federal league skin game and they come out and says Cobb and them had sined so theyd get me to sine but I was to smart for them and I guess may be I wont go threw that american league this yr. like gravy threw a sift.</p>
				<p>Just a little luck is all Im asking for and I guess I will have the luck all right because I still got that little old scarab and they couldent no body get it a way from me with out I was a corps.</p>
				<p>Im going to work easy from now til the season opens up and if Im feeling good I will make Callahan leave me open up and I will wire you a telegram a little wile a head and may be you can win a little bet on me because I wouldent give you no tip if I wasent sure what Im doing.
