				<p><b epub:type="z3998:salutation">Friend Al</b>: Well Al they have begin to bust up our regt. and take men away from it and the men they take will get to France before the rest of us the lucky stiffs but they don’t send them right to France from here but they send them down south to the national guards camps and fill up the national guards with them and the national guards are going to get across the pond first because Secty. Daniels wants to save the good <abbr>regts.</abbr> for the finish.</p>
				<p>Well Al they can’t send me to France to soon but it looks like they wasn’t a chance for a man like I to get sent with the national guards because the men we are sending down south is the riff and raff you might say who we want to get rid of them so when Secty. Daniels sends word that the national guards at such and such a place wants 7 or 800 men the officers here picks them out from amidst the kitchen policemen and the guard house.</p>
				<p>It looks now like the real soldiers that they got here would be here maybe all winter but between you and I Al I got a scheme to beat that game. I found out today that they are going to start a officers training camp here in <abbr>Jan.</abbr> and if a man makes good in it they will give him a lieut. or a capt. and they won’t be no riff and raff allowed in the camp only men that would make a good officer so I guess I won’t have no trouble getting in the camp and once I win my lieut. or capt. bars they will probably send me straight to France to take command.</p>
				<p>Things are going along OK without much news to write about. Sarah Bernhart the French comedian was in Rockford Friday and come out to give the boys a treat and for some reason another the most of the boys fell all over their self trying to get up close to her and get her to smile at them. Well Al everybody to their own taste but from what I seen of her she would be perfectly safe around me and if she is a day old she is 50 <abbr>yrs.</abbr> old and I will bet money on it. Any way I wouldn’t trade Florrie for a dozen like she.</p>

				<p><b epub:type="z3998:salutation">Friend Al</b>: Here is one for you Al and its just between you and I because I wouldn’t have no one else hear about it for the world. Yesterday we was all presented with some sox made out of knitting and they come in a bunch from the Red X and when I was going to bed I thought I would try mine on and see if they fit and if they didn’t maybe I could trade with somebody that they did. Well Al I stuck my foot down in 1 of them and my toe run into something funny and I pulled my foot out and stuck my hand down in it and pulled out a note that was folded in side of the sock. Well of course I opened the note up and read it and I will copy down what it said. It says “Dear Soldier Boy, you may never see me but if you can spare time to write me just a few lines it will make me happier than any one in the world for I am oh so lonesome. You won’t disappoint me will you Soldier Boy?” And it was signed Lone Star but down below she had wrote her name and address. Her name is Miss Lucy Chase and she lives in Texas.</p>
				<p>Well Al I can’t help from feeling sorry for her and if it wasn’t for Florrie and little Al I would write her a note back and thank her for the sox though between you and I they are to small and try and say something that would cheer her up. But of course Florrie wouldn’t like for me to do it and a married man shouldn’t ought to be monking around like that and lead a girl on though of course if I did write to her the first thing I would tell her would be that I am married.</p>
				<p>But what has been puzzling me is where she seen me. Maybe it was 1 of the times we played in Texas in the spring trip either that or she seen my picture somewheres. Well Al it must of been a picture without my feet in it or she would of made the sox bigger and I wish she had of because I don’t feel like tradeing them off to nobody now that I know they was made for me by a admirer. Laying all jokes to 1 side I do feel sorry for the girl and if she had of made herself known to me a few years sooner things might of been different. Don’t say nothing about this even to Bertha because I don’t want it to get all over Bedford. I am not the kind that brags around about their admirers especially when its a girl.</p>
				<p>I thought once or twice today that I would just drop her a card pretending like the sox fit me to a tea and thanking her for them and giving a hint that I was a married man but on second thoughts I guess its better to just let the whole affair drop right here.</p>
				<p>They sprung a new one on us last night. Word come from the head quarters that everybody had to learn to sing and last night was the first lesson and they was about 3000 of us and the teacher was a bird named Nevin and he got up in front and started out on Keep the home fires burning and said we was to all join in. Well Al for some reason another everybody but he had the lockjaw and as far as we was concerned the fires would of all died out. Most of our gang is from Chi where they leave takeing care of the furnace to the janitor. He tried 2 or 3 other songs but we was all deaf and dumb mutes and he finely give up and says he would try some other time when the cat didn’t have a hold of our tongue so on the way back to quarters everybody cut loose and sung and you could of heard us in Beloit. We got a lot of good singers right in our <abbr>Co.</abbr> that can hit the minors to but we are not going to bust out on no teacher’s say so like we was in kinder-garden or something.</p>
				<p>Well Al I am going to break into a new game football. They are getting up a club here in camp to play against the Great Lakes navy and the Camp Custer club up in Mich. and they want all the men thats played football to come out and try for the club here. Well I never played but I told them I did and they won’t know the difference when they see me because when a man is a born athelete they can play any game and especially a college Willy boy game like football. I seen one of their college games out to the university in Chi once and a man built like I could of made a sucker out of both clubs.</p>
				<p>The capt. of the camp club here is <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Capt.</abbr> Whiting and he played with the university of Chi and they got some other would be stars like Shiverick that played with the Ithaca club down east and Schobinger or something from Champlain college here in Ill. and a man from Princeton name Eddy something. Well I will show them something before I get through with them because an athelete has got to be born and you can’t make them out of college Willy boys that stays up all night doing the foxy trot and gets stewed on chocolate and whip cream.</p>

				<p><b epub:type="z3998:salutation">Friend Al</b>: Well Al I suppose you read in the papers about that troop train that a gang of spys tried to wreck it and it was a train full of burglars from here that we sent down to Camp Logan to fill up the national guards and the papers made out like the people that tried to wreck it was pro German spys but if you had of seen the birds that was on the train you wouldn’t believe it because they wouldn’t no Germans waist their time on them because they will all kill each other anyway before they get to France. One of the birds on it was Shorty Lahey that I all ready told you about him and when the national guards sees him they will just about declare war against Camp Grant.</p>
				<p>Well Al you remember me writeing to you about that little girl down in Texas that sent me the note in the sox. Well I got to thinking it over and the more I thought about it I got to thinking that it wasn’t the square thing to not pay no attention to her when she maybe wore her hands to the bone and strained her eyes so as my feet would keep warm so finely I set down and answered her back and I didn’t say nothing mushy of course but just a friendly note to let her know I received the sox and I told her they was a perfect fit and I asked her where it was she ever seen me or my picture or how she come to pick me out and I didn’t tell her nothing about being married because what would be the use of hurting her and they can’t be no harm done because we will never meet and as soon as she writes and tells me where she seen me that will end it. But I just couldn’t stand it to think of the poor kid running to the door every time the mail man come and maybe crying when they wasn’t nothing for her. I guess Florrie wouldn’t have no objections under the circumstances but if she did find out and start to ball me out I would tell her to take a jump in the lake because she never even mended me a pair of sox to say nothing about knit them. I also asked the girl to send me a picture of herself because it tickles them to be asked for their picture and of course as soon as I get it I will tear it up but she won’t know that.</p>
				<p>Well Al I decided to not play on the football club here after all. In the 1st. place theys 3 or 4 privates trying for the club and I don’t believe in mixing up with them to much and if Whiting and them other officers wants to all right, but that don’t make it all right in my mind. And besides I figured it wasn’t fair to either myself or <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Capt.</abbr> Nash to run the risk of getting hurt in some fool game to say nothing about learning a lot of fool signals that don’t mean nothing but just learning them takes up your time that you ought to spend thinking how to improve your command. And another thing the minute they started to practice I seen they didn’t know the fame and they will get licked every time they play and I can’t stand to be with a looser. They talked about what a great kicker this Shiverick is but I watched him trying to kick gools and he missed 3 out of 10 and one of them rolled right along the ground like a baby had kicked it.</p>
				<p><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Capt.</abbr> Whiting come up to me when I come out on the field and asked me my name and <abbr>etc.</abbr> and what position did I play and I told him center rush or tackle back it didn’t make no difference. So he asked me what college I played at and I told him Harvard which was the 1st. thing that come into my head. So he says “All right we need a good tackle back so you can play there now in signal practice” so they lined up and I stood back of the center rush and they called out some numbers and throwed the ball to one of them and 3 or 4 of us bumped into each other and fell down and I got a bad kick in the head but it wasn’t bad enough to make me quit but what is the use of takeing chances. They can have their football Al if they want to waist the <abbr>govt.</abbr> time but I got enough to think about thinking about winning this war.</p>

				<p><b epub:type="z3998:salutation">Friend Al</b>: Well this was our day out to the rifle range and I’ll say Secty. Daniels better hurry up and send some teachers here that knows their business. But wait till you hear about it.</p>
				<p>In the 1st. place it was a rotten day and a bad wind and so dark you couldn’t hardly see and they ought not to of made anybody try to shoot. Well they had some targets that they said was 100 yds. from where we was to shoot from but it was more like ¼ of a mile and they said 100 yds. so we would think it was closer. Well the idear was that each guy was to shoot 10 times and if you hit the target it counted 1 <abbr>pt.</abbr>. and if you hit the bulls eye it counted 5 pts. so if you hit the bulls eye every time you got 50 pts. but nobody in the world could do that the way they made us shoot. What do you think of them makeing a man lay on their stomach to shoot instead of standing up and I suppose if the Germans got 100 yds. from us we would all lay there like we had a stomache and let them come. Somebody said we layed that way so as to give them less mark to shoot at. How is that for fine dope? Because if you was laying on your stomach faceing them and they hit you at all they couldn’t hit you nowheres only in the head and kill you where if you was standing up straight they would be more libel to hit you anywheres except in the head and maybe you would get off with a flesh wound or something.</p>
				<p>Well 1 of the smart aleck lieuts. started out and hit the bulls eye 8 times and the target the other 2 times and that give him 42 and he swelled up like a poison pup but the way the wind was blowing you could tell it was just a accident because if he had of really shot at the target the wind would of carried his shots to hell and gone away from it but what he done was shoot with his eyes shut and the wind done the rest of it for him. So some of the other boys shot and some of them had a lot of luck and Red Sampson got 38 and finely it come my turn and I was dizzy from something I eat and besides by that time it was so dark you couldn’t hardly make out where the target was and I was all cramped up laying there but at that I just missed the bulls eye the 1st. time and finely quit with 8. So afterwards Red Sampson asked me how it come I didn’t have a expert rifle shooter’s meddle on me trying to kid me. So I said “I never had to shoot for a liveing because I could go out and pitch baseball and make real money where a man like you every time the family wanted meat for dinner they would send you out to shoot a snake or a tom cat or something.” So it was him that got kidded.</p>
				<p>Well Al I will be shooting with the best of them as soon as I get the nack and when they get a man here to learn us that knows his business and pick out a day when the wind ain’t blowing a mile a minute and pitch dark.</p>
				<p>I haven’t had no answer from that little girl down in Texas and I hope she has got over her infatuation and decided to forget me.</p>

				<p><b epub:type="z3998:salutation">Friend Al</b>: Well Al what do you think I got a letter from the girlie down in Texas and the poor kid has gone crazy over me and I only wish they was some way to stop her because of course it has got to end right here and I will just have to drop her a line and tell her the truth that I am a married man and the best thing she can do is try and forget. But I am afraid it will be pretty hard for her and I only wish she hadn’t never seen or heard about me.</p>
				<p>For some reason another she won’t tell me where it was she seen me or she won’t send me no picture because she says I might show it to the boys and laugh over that little girl down in Texas and of course I wouldn’t do nothing like that and she wouldn’t think so if she knew me better. Here is what her letter says.</p>
				<p>My Soldier Boy, so you are an officer now. Well that is just grand and I feel all the happier and prouder to hear from you. No Soldier Boy I won’t tell you where I saw you. You will just have to guess. Don’t you remember that day at⁠⸻? If you don’t I won’t tell you. And I won’t send you my photo because I know what soldier boys are. You would show it to everybody in camp and you would all have a good laugh over the little f⁠—l woman down in Texas who is fond of you. Well Boy we will probably never see each other unless you should happen to be sent to one of the camps down here. Is there any chance of that Soldier Boy? So you quit a job in the big league to fight for Uncle Sam? That was fine of you and makes me all the prouder to have your friendship. I am glad you like the hose I knitted for you. Do you want some more or can I make you a helmet or a sweater or something? Just say what you need and I will make my needles fly to furnish you with it. And write to me soon. We are so far apart that it takes your letters days and days to reach me. Au revoir for this time Big Boy.</p>
				<p>Well Al I can’t remember to save my soul where it was I and she could of met. Maybe I could if she had of put the name of the town in her letter but she just left a dash like I copied it. I been trying to think up all the girls I met in different towns while I was with the ball club and I can remember a lot of them but nobody named Chase but of course she might of give me a fake name the time we met.</p>
				<p>Well as I say theys only the 1 thing to do and that is drop her a line and say how things stand with me and for her to forget about me. Its mighty nice of her to offer to knit me them other articles but of course I can’t ask her to under the circumstances and all I can do is just to call it off or maybe it would be better to not write to her back but just leave her guess the truth only I am afraid she would think I was a bum to not acknollege her letter. I wish they was somebody to advice me what to do but I guess I can’t look for no help from you along those lines eh Al? You never had them looseing their heads and makeing garments for you and <abbr class="eoc">etc.</abbr></p>
				<p>I pretty near forgot to tell you that these college Willy boys got cleaned up 9 to 6 in their game with the sailors from the Great Lakes and the sailors made a monkey out of them and they wasn’t a kid on the sailors club that is 20 <abbr>yrs.</abbr> old. I bet <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Capt.</abbr> Whiting would of gave his right eye for a good husky tackle back when them sailors was pushing his Willys around the field.</p>

				<p><b epub:type="z3998:salutation">Friend Al</b>: Well they have just sent away another train load of the boys to 1 of the national guards and if they keep it up we won’t have more then 30 or 40 left to a <abbr>Co.</abbr> I wish I was with the boys that went but theys no chance of that because they are keeping the best men here so as we will be all together when they get ready to send us across. And it looks like I won’t be able to get into the officers training camp because I heard today that they won’t leave nobody in that can’t talk all the languages of the ally countrys. Red Sampson heard 2 of the lieuts. talking about it and 1 of them was saying how even the college boys would have to hustle between now and <abbr>Jan.</abbr> because while most of them could talk French and Italian they was very few colleges where you can learn Roman and Australian and <abbr>etc.</abbr> so it looks like I would be bared out because while I might pick up the French and maybe 1 or 2 others I couldn’t possibly master 8 or 9 languages in hardly a month you might say. I don’t know what the idear is but it probably come from the same guy that makes you shoot laying on your stomach.</p>
				<p>Speaking about a month my month without leave is pretty near up and I am figureing on going to Chi the 1st. of <abbr>Dec.</abbr> and see Florrie and little Al though for all as I know they both may be dead because Florrie won’t never suffer from writers cramp on my <abbr class="eoc">acct.</abbr> I have asked her 2 or 3 times to come out for Sunday and bring the kid but no its always to cold or she has got company comeing for dinner or 1 thing another.</p>
				<p>Sometimes I pretty near wish I had a wife like Sebastian’s thats so homely you can’t hardly look at her but still and all you get a chance to once in a while.</p>
				<p>Well I wrote to that poor kid down in Texas and told her I didn’t want to bother her to make me a helmet or a sweater but I all ready got a helmet. I didn’t have the heart to tell her about Florrie or tell her to quit writeing to me but I give her a kind of a hint that I was to busy to spend much time writeing letters and I hope she don’t try and keep up a correspondence because it can’t do neither of us no good and the best way would be for us to both forget it and of course that wouldn’t be no trouble for me but I am afraid a girl don’t forget so easy.</p>
				<p>Well Al this ain’t what you might call a happy letter but I don’t know no good news to write only they have gave up our choir practice as a bad job and we don’t have to worry no more about letting the fires go out.</p>

				<p><b epub:type="z3998:salutation">Friend Al</b>: Well Al I just got back from Chi and of all the tough luck a man ever had I had it.</p>
				<p>You remember me telling you about the last time I come back from my leave and I got in late and <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Capt.</abbr> Nash says I couldn’t have no more leave for a month. Well the month was up Friday and I had it fixed so as I could go to Chi Saturday <abbr class="time-of-day">a.m.</abbr> with the gang that was going to the football game between our club and Camp Custer and the only ones that was allowed to go was the ones that had boughten tickets to the game so I bought a ticket though I didn’t have no intentions of waisting my time out to no Willy boy football game.</p>
				<p>Well we got to Chi about noon and we had to march all over town and everybody stood on the sidewalks and cheered us to the ecco and I couldn’t get away from the bunch till the parade was over though I don’t enjoy marching and have everybody stare at you but when it was over I beat it for home. Well I hadn’t said nothing to Florrie about comeing because I wanted to surprise her and I thought of course little Al and the Swede would be home and I and little Al could walk in on Florrie over to the beauty parlor and surprise her, but when I got to the flat and rung the bell they wasn’t no answer and I rung and rung and finely I seen they wasn’t nobody home so I went to the beauty parlor and 1 of the girls there told be that Florrie was takeing the <abbr class="time-of-day">p.m.</abbr> off and wouldn’t be back till Monday <abbr class="time-of-day eoc">a.m.</abbr></p>
				<p>So I went back to the flat and looked for the janitor to let me in and when you don’t want janitors they are always snooping around at your coat tails but when you do want them they are hideing in the ash <abbr>bbl.</abbr> or something. So it took me about a hour to find this bird and another hour to get him to open the door up for me and of course they wasn’t nobody home so the janitor says maybe I could find out where they went from the neighbors so I rung the woman across the hall’s bell and she come to the door. So I said “I’m Corp. Keefe and I wanted to know if you knew where is my wife and kid.” So she says “They went out.” Well Al I suppose I didn’t know they had went out and I felt like saying to her “Oh I thought they might maybe of crawled in between the wall paper to take a nap or I thought maybe they might of left the stopper out of the bath tub and got drained off or something.” But I just asked her did she know where they went and she said she didn’t.</p>
				<p>Well I seen she didn’t know nothing about them or probably nothing else so I went back in the flat and waited and waited and it come along 5 o’clock and I called up a saloon over on Indiana and asked them to fetch me over a <abbr>doz.</abbr> bottles of beer and I had 2 of them and then went out to a restaurant and had supper and come back and nobody home yet. Well to make a short story out of it I finished the beer up and finely went to bed and I didn’t know nothing more till 9 <abbr class="time-of-day">a.m.</abbr> this morning when the Swede come snooping into the room and seen me and let out a screem and beat it and I got up and dressed and went in the kitchen and she said Florrie had took little Al somewheres to stay all night with some friends and give the Swede permission to go to a ski jumpers dance out to Berwyn and Florrie would be home about 11.</p>
				<p>Well Florrie come strutting in with the kid about 12 looking like she hadn’t done nothing out of the way and when she seen me she squeeled and come romping over for a kiss. Well Al she didn’t get it. I kissed little Al all right but I didn’t see where she had a right to expect favors. Well she seen how things stood and begin trying to explain something about spending the <abbr class="time-of-day">p.m.</abbr> down town shopping and then going to a show with some friends of hers on the north side and they left little Al in charge of the nurse at the friends and they both stayed there all night and why didn’t I tell her I would be home so as she could have changed her plans and <abbr class="eoc">etc.</abbr> So I said “Yes you are a fine wife and mother running around town with a bunch of bums and leave your kid all alone in charge of a nurse that you don’t know nothing about her and for all as you know she might of cut his ears off like a Belgium.” Well I was sore and I give her a good balling out and of course it wound up like usual with her busting out crying and then they wasn’t nothing for me to do only say I didn’t mean what I had been saying and we had dinner and maybe everything would of been OK only we hadn’t no sooner gotten up from the table when in come ½ of the south side and their wifes to call. Well they wasn’t none of them I ever seen before or ever want to see them again and they was all friends of Florrie’s and 2 of the ladys was customers of hers so she didn’t dare tell them to get the h-ll out of there and a <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Crane and a <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Somebody else picked on me and got me in a pocket on the Davenport and they didn’t even have sence enough to call me Corporal but it was <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Keefe this and <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Keefe that and when did I think the war would end and wasn’t the Germans awful and how many men did we have in France and when was I going and so on. And <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Crane said her and all her friends was so jealous of <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Keefe because her husband was a soldier so I said I had heard they was room in some of the camps for a few more husbands and <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Crane said her husband had tried his hardest to get into something but he had bad teeth so I said why didn’t he try and get into some good dentist office. But they wasn’t no way I could get them mad enough to go home till 5 o’clock then I and Florrie and the kid had just a hour together before I had to beat it for the train.</p>
				<p>Well Al I won’t get no more leave off till Xmas and maybe not then but what is the use any way when your wife gives you a welcome like that and all together it was a fine trip and I won’t never try and take nobody by surprise after this but at that why couldn’t she of stayed home where a woman belongs.</p>
				<p>My train was jamed comeing back tonight and I don’t know where they got it but everybody was oiled up and celebrating about beating Camp Custer in the football game and I’ll say Camp Custer must be a home for cripples or something if that’s the kind of a football club they turn out any way I bet they ain’t no room to dance in the guard house tonight.</p>

				<p><b epub:type="z3998:salutation">Friend Al</b>: I guess I was so full of my swell visit home when I wrote you the last time that I forgot about telling you about that little girlie down in Texas. Well Al they isn’t much to tell only that I got another letter from her though I as good as told her I wished she wouldn’t write me no more but she wrote any way and she says she can’t forget me and theys no use asking her to and she wouldn’t tell me where it was we seen each other and they was no use me asking her. It looks from her letter like she was getting in deeper every day and I don’t know what will be the end of it all and if she done anything to herself on my <abbr>acct.</abbr> I would feel like a murder though of course a man can’t help how they look or what a girl thinks about them but still and all you can’t help from feeling like you was to blame.</p>
				<p>I guess the best way to do is just not answer her letter and hope for the best and hope she won’t do nothing rash.</p>
				<p>Well Al I started out to write you a long letter but I am to wore out and I guess anybody would be after what we went through today. It was the coldest day I ever seen so they picked it out for us to go on a 19 mile hike and if you could see the roads around here you would know what that means and they can talk all they want to about how the men suffers in France but I would rather go out in the middle of Nobody’s Land and start a mumblety peg game then take another of these dam hikes with the weather a million below zero and the road full of rutts as big as the grand canion.</p>
				<p>If it hadn’t been for setting a example to my command I believe I would of pretended like I was sick and when you are sick they make somebody else carry your junk and leave you ride in a wagon thats OK for a private that don’t care what the rest of them think of him but a corporal has got to keep going and try to keep his men going and when you got a bunch of sap heads like mine it keeps a man on the jump to tend to them. Red Sampson was so bad that I had to keep after him all the while and finely I pulled a good one on him I said “Sampson everybody in the whole regt. is out of step but you.” So the rest of them give him the laugh but he can’t take a joke no matter how good it is so he says “I haven’t heard that one since they fought with spears.” So I said “You get in step and show a little life or I’ll spear you.”</p>
				<p>Well its all over now any way and I don’t suppose they will send us out again till theys a big blizzard or something and then they will march us to Canada or somewheres for a little work out.</p>

					<p epub:type="se:letter.dateline">Camp Grant, <abbr>Dec.</abbr> 7.</p>
				</header>
				<p><b epub:type="z3998:salutation">Friend Al</b>: Well Al I got some big news for you. The <abbr>govt.</abbr> have changed their plans all around and decided after this to send the best men from the national army to fill up the national guards and that means theys a big bunch of us leaveing soon for Camp Logan down in Texas and the officers say we musent spill nothing about it that is when we are going because if the pro German spys ever found out that our bunch was going down there they would spread the rails and turn switches on us and probably put torpedos on the track or something. So all as I can say is that you won’t hear from me here no more and I can’t tell you what units we will be in because we haven’t got no official notice yet and all as I know is what some of the boys heard that we would be in <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Col.</abbr> House’s regt. I thought when I 1st. heard the news that it meant we would be starting for France pretty quick and of course I didn’t stop to think that they have closed up navigations for the winter.</p>
				<p>Well Al I am glad we are going somewheres for the winter where it isn’t so dam cold and of course I don’t like to be so far away from home but maybe Florrie can get away and come down there and join me for a while and I am going to have a few hours off any way to say good bye to little Al and she and I wish I could see you and Bertha before I go especially you but theys no chance so good bye and good luck to you and I will write when I can.</p>
				<p>I just happened to think Al that Camp Logan is in Texas and thats where that little girl lives but you can bet I won’t leave her know where I am because in the 1st. place she would probably be just crazy enough to want to see me or something and besides I wrote her a farewell note yesterday and asked her wouldn’t she send me her picture because I thought that would make her feel a little happier to think I wanted her picture even if we don’t keep on writeing letters and I don’t care if she sends it or not any way if she sent it up here I will probably be gone before that time.</p>
				<p>Well Al I will be kind of sorry to leave Camp Grant where all and all we have had a pretty good time and I guess Gen. Martin and them will be sorry to see our bunch duck out and they will have a fine bunch left when we go but I am glad we won’t freeze to death this winter and besides that they tell me the national guards is shy of officers and maybe I may not stay a corporal long after I get there but will get something bigger though a corporal can’t be sneezed at.</p>

				<p><b epub:type="z3998:salutation">Friend Al</b>: Well old pal here we are in sunny Texas and its been pretty cold so far but nothing like it was up at Camp Grant and of course it don’t never get as cold here as up there on <abbr>acct.</abbr> of this being further south.</p>
				<p>Well nothing happened to us on the way down though of course it would of been good night nurse if it had got out what road we come on and when we left and even at that we seen some bad eggs at several different stations that looked like Germans that might of tried to pull something if they had a chance but we watched them like a hawk and they was scared to make a false move.</p>
				<p>Well Al what do you think they have made Shorty Lahey a sargent down here only thank god he isn’t in my <abbr>Co.</abbr> or I would be up in front of the court’s marshall for murder. But him being a sargent shows they must of been pretty hard up and you can bet they was tickled to death to see our bunch roll in. Well Al if he can get a sargent I will be a gen. in a month. He says to me yesterday he says “Well old sport I wish they had of put you in my <abbr>Co.</abbr> and you would do the rest of your drilling with a dish towel.” So I said “Yes I would.”</p>
				<p>Well after thinking it over a while I decided I better write to the little girl and tell her where I was at because I asked her in my farewell note for her to send me her picture of herself and if she sent it up to Camp Grant maybe 1 of them rummys might get a hold of it and open it up and then write back to the girl and kid her about it and I figured maybe if I let her know I was down here that maybe she hadn’t sent the picture up there yet. But I didn’t give her no encouragement to write to me here and all I said was that if she ever happened to be in Houston and I happened to be in town on leave maybe we might run into each other but I just said that jokeingly because her town is about a 100 miles from here and what would she be doing a 100 miles from home and besides even if I seen her on the <abbr>st.</abbr> I doubt if I would know her though I generally almost always remember faces though I can’t always remember their names. But if she seen me and spoke to me I would pretend like I didn’t hear her and duck because it would only make it tougher for her to talk to me because I would have to tell her the truth. But I guess its all over between us now and any way I hope so.</p>

				<p><b epub:type="z3998:salutation">Friend Al</b>: Well old pal I am up against a funny proposition now and it isn’t so dam funny at that. Here is a letter I received this <abbr class="time-of-day">a.m.</abbr> from that girlie. I will copy it down.</p>
				<p>“Soldier Boy, so we are going to meet at last. Yes we are, that is if you want it to happen. My aunt in Houston has been wanting me to come there for months, but not till now have I really wanted to. You know why I do now, don’t you Soldier Boy? You say it is easier for you to get off Sundays. All right. Will you meet me in the lobby of the Rice Hotel a week from today at one in the afternoon. I will let you take me to dinner and we can talk things over. We have a lot to say to each other, haven’t we Soldier. Boy? Write me at once and say you will meet me. I can hardly wait to get your reply and if you disappoint me I will do something to make you sorry. But you won’t will you? I am just finishing your sweater and will bring it to you.”</p>
				<p>Well Al when the letter come I had a notion to write to her back and tell her to not come but in her letter she said she would do something to make me sorry and I am afraid of what she would do and if she done something rash I would feel like it was my fault and besides if she has got a sweater pretty near made for me it would be kind of mean to of made her do all that work for nothing and besides a man needs a sweater a lot of times even down here and I was going to buy one because I didn’t have no idear she was makeing one for me. So I figure the best way to do is to tell her I will meet her and I will take her somewheres to dinner and while we are at dinner I can tell her the truth about me being married and it will be much better to tell her to her face then write it in a letter because it would sound pretty hard in black and white but the only thing is we have got to find some quite spot so as if she makes a seen or something they won’t be no crowd around to pop their eyes out at us. But I hope she is a game bird and will take it OK and I’m sorry now I didn’t tell her in the 1st. place and I wish she wasn’t comeing and I sometimes wish I was a little scrimp or ugly so as a girl wouldn’t look at me twice and between you and I Al it isn’t all a bed of roses to be like I am.</p>
				<p>I will write and tell you how I come out but I am to exited to write any more now and I wish they was some way I could get out of it all without leaveing no scars.</p>

				<p><b epub:type="z3998:salutation">Friend Al</b>: I bet you will pop your eyes out when you read this letter and read what I got to tell you. I will begin at the beginning and tell you what come off so as you will know what come off.</p>
				<p>Saturday I pretty near made up my mind that it would be better for me to not see Miss Chase so when I asked for leave for yesterday I hoped they wouldn’t give it to me but they give it to me OK so I had to come or it would look funny. Well I come into the Rice at about 5 min, to 1 and looked around the lobby and they was only one woman that was alone and she was old about 35 and I looked around and couldn’t see no girl that looked like they was waiting for somebody, and while I was looking this woman I seen seen me and come over to where I was standing. Well Al I thought sure it was the girl’s aunt and she had heard about our date and was going to raise h-ll or something. Well this woman come up and says wasn’t I Corporal Keefe. Well I didn’t know what to say and I kind of stalled and she says “Was you expecting to meet some one here?” So I said “Yes I was looking for a man.” So then she kind of smirked and says “Well I was expecting to meet a man to and I thought you was him.” So I said “No I guess you have got the wrong bird.”</p>
				<p>Well Al everything would of been OK and I could of got away OK only just when I had her beleiving it wasn’t me who should come up but Lefty Kramer that pitchs in the Texas League and lives here and instead of him just saying “Hello Jack” of course he had to say “Well if here ain’t old Jack Keefe” and then it was good night. Well I suppose I turned into all the colors of the rainbow and I didn’t know what to say and then Lefty asked right out loud if I wasn’t going to introduce him to the lady and she spoke up and said her name Miss Chase and then I had to say something so I said “Oh I didn’t know you was really Miss Chase or I would of acted different but I thought you was somebody else.” So she kind of give a funny smile and says “Yes you did” and then all of a sudden I heard little Al’s voice right behind hollering “There’s daddy” and I looked around and it was Florrie and little Al.</p>
				<p>Well Al Florrie come up and kissed me right in front of the whole hotel and the next thing I know the 3 of us was away from Kramer and the dame and Florrie was telling me how she had came down to give me a Xmas supprise and she is going to stay about 3 <abbr>wks.</abbr> and spend some of the time with her sister over in Beaumont.</p>
				<p>Well I took a look just as we was going up in the elevator and Miss Chase was still standing there yet with Kramer and she was looking right at me and I couldn’t help from feeling sorry for her the way she looked but a woman her age should ought to know more then start writeing letters to a guy she never seen and maybe this will learn her a lesson and I suppose she can give her sweater to somebody else and maybe Kramer has got it by this time but what he ought to have is a wallop in the jaw for butting in but what can you expect from a left hander.</p>
				<p>Well Al I have got a leave off for over Xmas and I am writeing this letter while Florrie is out shopping and she asked me what I wanted for Xmas and I told her a sweater so I won’t loose out after all.</p>

				<p><b epub:type="z3998:salutation">Friend Al</b>: Well Al this may be the last time you will ever hear from me or at least for a long time and maybe never. I’m going over there old pal and something tells me I won’t never come back.</p>
				<p>I can’t tell you what I am going with or when we go or where we sail from because they won’t leave us give out none of that dope and all as I can say is that about 30 of us has been picked to fill up a unit and we leave here tomorrow and meet them at the place where we sail from. Well Al its a big honor to be 1 of the men picked and it means they have got a lot of confidence in me and you can bet they are not sending no riff and raff over there but just picked men and I will show them they didn’t make no mistake in choosing me.</p>
				<p>But its mighty tough to leave Florrie and little Al and I thought Florrie would break her heart when I told her and no wonder. But when its a question of duty I am not the kind that would back out and Florrie wouldn’t want me to but its hard all the same.</p>
				<p>Well Al I can’t waist no more time writeing to you and I am going to meet Florrie in Houston in a little while and it may be for the last time so I will say good bye to you now and say good bye to Bertha for me and she ought to be thankful she has got a husband that stayed at home and didn’t enlist. And if we have good luck and nothing happens to us I will write you once in a while from the other side.</p>
