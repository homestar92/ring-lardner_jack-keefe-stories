				<p><b epub:type="z3998:salutation">Friend Al</b>: Well Al I suppose it is kind of foolish to be writeing you a letter now when they won’t be no chance to mail it till we get across the old pond but still and all a man has got to do something to keep themself busy and I know you will be glad to hear all about our trip so I might as well write you a letter when ever I get a chance and I can mail them to you all at once when we get across the old pond and you will think I have wrote a book or something.</p>
				<p>Jokeing a side Al you are lucky to have an old pal thats going to see all the fun and write to you about it because its a different thing haveing a person write to you about what they see themself then getting the dope out of a newspaper or something because you will know that what I tell you is the real dope that I seen myself where if you read it in a newspaper you know its guest work because in the 1st. place they don’t leave the reporters get nowheres near the front and besides that they wouldn’t go there if they had a leave because they would be to scared like the baseball reporters that sets a mile from the game because they haven’t got the nerve to get down on the field where a man could take a punch at them and even when they are a mile away with a screen in front of them they duck when somebody hits a pop foul.</p>
				<p>Well Al it is against the rules to tell you when we left the old <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism z3998:place">U.S.</abbr> or where we come away from because the pro German spy might get a hold of a man’s letter some way and then it would be good night because he would send a telegram to where the submarines is located at and they wouldn’t send no 1 or 2 submarines after us but the whole German navy would get after us because they would figure that if they ever got us it would be a rich hall. When I say that Al I don’t mean it to sound like I was swell headed or something and I don’t mean it would be a rich hall because I am on board or nothing like that but you would know what I am getting at if you seen the bunch we are takeing across.</p>
				<p>In the 1st. place Al this is a different kind of a trip then the time I went around the world with the 2 ball clubs because then it was just the 1 boat load and only for two or 3 of the boys on board it wouldn’t of made no difference if the boat had of turned a turtle only to pave the whole bottom of the ocean with ivory. But this time Al we have got not only 1 boat load but we got four boat loads of soldiers alone and that is not all we have got. All together Al there is 10 boats in the parade and 6 of them is what they call the convoys and that means war ships that goes along to see that we get there safe on acct. of the submarines and four of them is what they call destroyers and they are little bits of shafers but they say they can go like he‑⁠ll when they get started and when a submarine pops up these little birds chases right after them and drops a death bomb on to them and if it ever hits them the capt. of the submarine can pick up what is left of his boat and stick a 2 cent stamp on it and mail it to the kaiser.</p>
				<p>Jokeing a side I guess they’s no chance of a submarine getting fat off of us as long as these little birds is on watch so I don’t see why a man shouldn’t come right out and say when we left and from where we come from but if they didn’t have some kind of rules they’s a lot of guys that wouldn’t know no better then write to Van Hinburg or somebody and tell them all they know but I guess at that they could use a post card.</p>
				<p>Well Al we been at sea just two days and a lot of the boys has gave up the ghost all ready and pretty near everything else but I haven’t felt the least bit sick that is sea sick but I will own up I felt a little home sick just as we come out of the harbor and seen the godess of liberty standing up there maybe for the last time but don’t think for a minute Al that I am sorry I come and I only wish we was over there all ready and could get in to it and the only kick I got comeing so far is that we haven’t got no further then we are now on acct. that we didn’t do nothing the 1st. day only stall around like we was waiting for Connie Mack to waggle his score card or something.</p>
				<p>But we will get there some time and when we do you can bet we will show them something and I am tickled to death I am going and if I lay down my life I will feel like it wasn’t throwed away for nothing like you would die of tyford fever or something.</p>
				<p>Well I would of liked to of had Florrie and little Al come east and see me off but Florrie felt like she couldn’t afford to spend the money to make another long trip after making one long trip down to Texas and besides we wasn’t even supposed to tell our family where we was going to sail from but I notice they was a lot of women folks right down to the dock to bid us good by and I suppose they just guessed what was comeing off eh Al? Or maybe they was all strangers that just happened to be there but I’ll say I never seen so much kissing between strangers. Any way I and my family had our farewells out west and Florrie was got up like a fancy dress ball and I suppose if I die where she can tend the funeral she will come in pink tights or something.</p>
				<p>Well Al I better not keep on talking about Florrie and little Al or I will do the baby act and any way its pretty near time for chow but I suppose you will wonder what am I talking about when I say chow. Well Al that’s the name we boys got up down to Camp Grant for stuff to eat and when we talk about food instead of saying food we say chow so that’s what I am getting at when I say its pretty near time for chow.</p>

				<p><b epub:type="z3998:salutation">Friend Al</b>: Well Al here we are out somewheres in the middle of the old pond and I wished the trip was over not because I have been sea sick or anything but I can’t hardly wait to get over there and get in to it and besides they got us jammed in like a sardine or something and four of us in 1 state room and I don’t mind doubleing up with some good pal but a man can’t get no rest when they’s four trying to sleep in a room that wouldn’t be big enough for Nemo Liebold but I wouldn’t make no holler at that if they had of left us pick our own roomys but out of the four of us they’s one that looks like he must of bribed the jury or he wouldn’t be here and his name is Smith and another one’s name is Sam Hall and he has always got a grouch on and the other boy is OK only I would like him a whole lot better if he was about ½ his size but no he is as big as me only not put up like I am. His name is Lee and he pulls a lot of funny stuff like this <abbr class="time-of-day">a.m.</abbr>. he says they must of thought us four was a male quartette and they stuck us all in together so as we could get some close harmony. That’s what they call it when they hit them minors.</p>
				<p>Well Al I always been use to sleeping with my feet in bed with me but you can’t do that in the bunk I have got because your knee would crack you in the jaw and knock you out and even if they was room to strech Hall keeps crabbing till you can’t rest and he keeps the room filled up with cigarette smoke and no air and you can’t open up the port hole or you would freeze to death so about the only chance I get to sleep is up in the parlor in a chair in the day time and you don’t no sooner set down when they got a life boat drill or something and for some reason another they have a role call every day and that means everybody has got to answer to their name to see if we are all on board just as if they was any other place to go.</p>
				<p>When they give the signal for a life boat drill everybody has got to stick their life belt on and go to the boat where they have been given the number of it and even when everybody knows its a fake you got to show up just the same and yesterday they was one bird thats supposed to go in our life boat and he was sea sick and he didn’t show up so they went after him and one of the officers told him that wasn’t no excuse and what would he do if he was sea sick and the ship was realy sinking and he says he thought it was realy sinking ever since we started.</p>
				<p>Well Al we got some crowd on the boat and they’s two French officers along with us that been giveing drills and <abbr>etc.</abbr> in one of the camps in the <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism z3998:place">U.S.</abbr> and navy officers and gunners and a man would almost wish something would happen because I bet we would put up some battle.</p>
				<p>Lee just come in and asked me who was I writeing to and I told him and he says I better be careful to not write nothing against anybody on the trip just as if I would. But any way I asked him why not and he says because all the mail would be opened and read by the censor so I said “Yes but he won’t see this because I won’t mail it till we get across the old pond and then I will mail all my letters at once.”</p>
				<p>So he said a man can’t do it that way because just before we hit land the censor will take all our mail off of us and read it and cut out whatever he don’t like and then mail it himself. So I didn’t know we had a censor along with us but Lee says we certainly have got one and he is up in the front ship and they call that the censor ship on acct. of him being on there.</p>
				<p>Well Al I don’t care what he reads and what he don’t read because I am not the kind that spill anything about the trip that would hurt anybody or get them in bad. So he is welcome to read anything I write you might say.</p>
				<p>This front ship is the slowest one of the whole four and how is that for fine judgment Al to put the slowest one ahead and this ship we are on is the fastest and they keep us behind instead of leaving us go up ahead and set the pace for them and no wonder we never get nowheres. Of course that ain’t the censor’s fault but if the old <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism z3998:place">U.S.</abbr> is in such a hurry to get men across the pond I should think they would use some judgment and its just like as if Hughey Jennings would stick Oscar Stanage or somebody ahead of Cobb in the batting order so as Cobb couldn’t make to many bases on a hit.</p>
				<p>Well Al I will have to cut it out for now because its pretty near time for chow and that’s the name we got up out to Camp Grant for meals and now everybody in the army when they talk about food they call it chow.</p>

				<p><b epub:type="z3998:salutation">Friend Al</b>: Well Al they have got a new nickname for me and now they call me Jack Tar and Bob Lee got it up and I will tell you how it come off. Last night was one rough bird and I guess pretty near everybody on the boat were sick and Lee says to me how was it that I stood the rough weather so good and it didn’t seem to effect me so I says it was probably on acct. of me going around the world that time with the two ball clubs and I was right at home on the water so he says “I guess we better call you Jack Tar.”</p>
				<p>So that’s how they come to call me Jack Tar and its a name they got for old sailors that’s been all their life on the water. So on acct. of my name being Jack it fits in pretty good.</p>
				<p>Well a man can’t help from feeling sorry for the boys that have not been across the old pond before and can’t stand a little rough spell but it makes a man kind of proud to think the rough weather don’t effect you when pretty near everybody else feels like a churn or something the minute a drop of water splashes <abbr>vs.</abbr> the side of the boat but still a man can’t hardly help from laughing when they look at them.</p>
				<p>Lee says he would of thought I would of enlisted in the navy on acct. of being such a good sailor. Well I would of Al if I had knew they needed men and I told Lee so and he said he thought the <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism z3998:place">U.S.</abbr> made a big mistake keeping it a secret that they did need men in the navy till all the good ones enlisted in the draft and then of course the navy had to take what they could get.</p>
				<p>Well I guess I all ready told you that one of the boys in our room is named Freddie Smith and he don’t never say a word and I thought at 1st. it was because he was a kind of a bum like Hall that didn’t know nothing and that’s why he didn’t say it but it seems the reason he don’t talk more is because he can’t talk English very good but he is a Frenchman and he was a waiter in the big French resturent in Milwaukee and now what do you think Al he is going to learn Lee and I French lessons and Lee fixed it up with him. We want to learn how to talk a little so when we get there we can make ourself understood and you remember I started studing French out to Camp Grant but the man down there didn’t know nothing about what he was talking about so I walked out on him but this bird won’t try and learn us grammer or how you spell it or nothing like that but just a few words so as we can order drinks and meals and <abbr>etc.</abbr> when we get a leave off some time. Tonight we are going to have our 1st. lesson and with a man like he to learn us we ought to pick it up quick.</p>
				<p>Well old pal I will wind up for this time as I don’t feel very good on acct. of something I eat this noon and its a wonder a man can keep up at all where they got you in a stateroom jammed in like a sardine or something and Hall smokeing all the while like he was a freight engine pulling a freight train up grade or something.</p>

				<p><b epub:type="z3998:salutation">Friend Al</b>: Just a line Al because I don’t feel like writeing as I was taken sick last night from something I eat and who wouldn’t be sick jammed in a room like a sardine.</p>
				<p>I had a kind of a run in with Hall because he tried to kid me about being sick with some of his funny stuff but I told him where to head in. He started out by saying to Lee that Jack Tar looked like somebody had knocked the tar out of him and after a while he says “What’s the matter with the old salt tonight he don’t seem to have no pepper with him.” So I told him to shut up.</p>
				<p>Well we didn’t have no French lesson on acct. of me being taken sick but we are going to have a lesson tonight and pretty soon I am going up and try and eat something and I hope they don’t try and hand me no more of that canned beans or whatever it was that effected me and if Uncle Sam wants his boys to go over there and put up a battle he shouldn’t try and poison them first.</p>

				<p><b epub:type="z3998:salutation">Friend Al</b>: Well Al I was talking to one of the sailors named Doran today and he says in a day or 2 more we would be right in the danger zone where all the subs hangs out and then would come the fun and we would probably all have to keep our clothes on all night and keep our life belts on and I asked him if they was much danger with all them convoys guarding us and he says the subs might fire a periscope right between two of the convoys and hit our ship and maybe the convoys might get them afterwards but then it would be to late.</p>
				<p>He said the last time he come over with troops they was two subs got after this ship and they shot two periscopes at this ship and just missed it and they seem to be laying for this ship because its one of the biggest and fastest the <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism z3998:place">U.S.</abbr> has got.</p>
				<p>Well I told Doran it wouldn’t bother me to keep my clothes on all night because I all ready been keeping them on all night because when you have got a state room like ours they’s only one place where they’s room for a man’s clothes and that’s on you.</p>
				<p>Well old pal they’s a whole lot of difference between learning something from somebody that knows what they are talking about and visa versa. I and Lee and Smith got together in the room last night and we wasn’t at it more than an hour but I learned more then all the time I took lessons from that 4 flusher out to Camp Grant because Smith don’t waist no time with a lot of junk about grammer but I or Lee would ask him what was the French for so and so and he would tell us and we would write it down and say it over till we had it down pat and I bet we could pretty near order a meal now without no help from some of these smart alex that claims they can talk all the languages in the world.</p>
				<p>In the 1st. place they’s a whole lot of words in French that they’s no difference you might say between them from the way we say it like beef steak and beer because Lee asked him if suppose we went in somewheres and wanted a steak and bread and butter and beer and the French for and is und so we would say beef steak und brot mit butter schmieren und bier and that’s all they is to it and I can say that without looking at the paper where we wrote it down and you can see I have got that much learned all ready so I wouldn’t starve and when you want to call a waiter you call him kellner so you see I could go in a place in Paris and call a waiter and get everything I wanted. Well Al I bet nobody ever learned that much in I hour off that bird out to Camp Grant and I’ll say its some speed.</p>
				<p>We are going to have another lesson tonight but Lee says we don’t want to try and learn to, much at once or we will forget what we all ready learned and they’s a good deal to that Al.</p>
				<p>Well Al its time for chow again so lebe wohl and that’s the same like good by in French.</p>

				<p><b epub:type="z3998:salutation">Friend Al</b>: Well Al we are in what they call the danger zone and they’s some excitement these days and at night to because they don’t many of the boys go to sleep nights and they go to their rooms and pretend like they are going to sleep but I bet you wouldn’t need no alarm clock to make them jump out of bed.</p>
				<p>Most of the boys stays out on deck most of the time and I been staying out there myself most all day today not because I am scared of anything because I always figure if its going to happen its going to happen but I stay out because it ain’t near as cold as it was and besides if something is comeing off I don’t want to miss it. Besides maybe I could help out some way if something did happen.</p>
				<p>Last night we was all out on deck in the dark talking about this and that and one of the boys I was standing along side of him made the remark that we had been out nine days and he didn’t see no France yet or no signs of getting there so I said no wonder when we had such a he‑⁠ll of a censor ship and some other guy heard me say it so he said I better not talk like that but I didn’t mean it like that but only how slow it was.</p>
				<p>Well we are getting along OK with the French lessons and Bob Lee told me last night that he run across one of the two French officers that’s on the ship and he thought he would try some of his French on him so he said something about it being a nice day in French and the Frenchman was tickled to death and smiled and bowed at him and I guess I will try it out on them the next time I see them.</p>
				<p>Well Al that shows we been learning something when the Frenchmans themself know what we are talking about and I and Lee will have the laugh on the rest of the boys when we get there that is if we do get there but for some reason another I have got a hunch that we won’t never see France and I can’t explain why but once in a while a man gets a hunch and a lot of times they are generally always right.</p>

				<p><b epub:type="z3998:salutation">Friend Al</b>: Well Al I was just out on deck with Lee and Sargent Bishop and Bishop is a sargent in our <abbr>Co.</abbr> and he said he had just came from <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Capt.</abbr> Seeley and <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Capt.</abbr> Seeley told him to tell all the <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">N.C.O</abbr>. officers like sargents and corporals that if a sub got us we was to leave the privates get into the boats first before we got in and we wasn’t to get into our boats till all the privates was safe in the boats because we would probably be cooler and not get all excited like the privates. So you see Al if something does happen us birds will have to take things in hand you might say and we will have to stick on the job and not think about ourselfs till everybody else is taken care of.</p>
				<p>Well Lee said that Doran one of the sailors told him something on the quiet that didn’t never get into the newspapers and that was about one of the trips that come off in December and it seems like a whole fleet of subs got on to it that some transports was comeing so they layed for them and they shot a periscope at one of the transports and hit it square in the middle and it begun to sink right away and it looked like they wouldn’t nobody get into the boats but the sargents and corporals was as cool as if nothing was comeing off and they quieted the soldiers down and finely got them into the boats and the <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">N.C.O</abbr>. officers was so cool and done so well that when Gen. Pershing heard about it he made this rule about the <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">N.C.O</abbr>. officer always waiting till the last so they could kind of handle things. But Doran also told Lee that they was some men sunk with the ship and they was all <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">N.C.O</abbr>. officers except one sailor and of course the ship sunk so quick that some of the corporals and sargents didn’t have no time to get off on acct. of haveing to wait till the last. So you see that when you read the newspapers you don’t get all the dope because they don’t tell the reporters only what they feel like telling them.</p>
				<p>Well Al I guess I told you all ready about me haveing this hunch that I wouldn’t never see France and I guess it looks now more then ever like my hunch was right because if we get hit I will have to kind of look out for the boys that’s in my boat and not think about myself till everybody else is OK and Doran says if this ship ever does get hit it will sink quick because its so big and heavy and of course the heavier a ship is it will sink all the sooner and Doran says he knows they are laying for us because he has made five trips over and back on this ship and he never was on a trip when a sub didn’t get after them.</p>
				<p>Well I will close for this time because I am not feeling very good Al and it isn’t nothing I eat or like that but its just I feel kind of faint like I use to sometimes when I would pitch a tough game in <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">St.</abbr> Louis when it was hot or something.</p>

				</header>
				<p><b epub:type="z3998:salutation">Friend Al</b>: Well I all ready wrote you one letter today but I kind of feel like I better write to you again because any minute we are libel to hear a bang against the side of the boat and you know what that means and I have got a hunch that I won’t never get off of the ship alive but will go down with her because I wouldn’t never leave the ship as long as they was anybody left on her rules or no rules but I would stay and help out till every man was off and then of course it would be to late but any way I would go down feeling like I had done my duty. Well Al when a man has got a hunch like that he would be a sucker to not pay no tension to it and that is why I am writeing to you again because I got some things I want to say before the end.</p>
				<p>Now old pal I know that Florrie hasn’t never warmed up towards you and Bertha and wouldn’t never go down to Bedford with me and pay you a visit and every time I ever give her a hint that I would like to have you and Bertha come up and see us she always had some excuse that she was going to be busy or this and that and of course I knew she was trying to alibi herself and the truth was she always felt like Bertha and her wouldn’t have nothing in common you might say because Florrie has always been a swell dresser and cared a whole lot about how she looked and some way she felt like Bertha wouldn’t feel comfortable around where she was at and maybe she was right but we can forget all that now Al and I can say one thing Al she never said nothing reflecting on you yourself in any way because I wouldn’t of stood for it but instead of that when I showed her that picture of you and Bertha in your wedding suit she made the remark that you looked like one of the honest homely kind of people that their friends could always depend on them. Well Al when she said that she hit the nail on the head and I always knew you was the one pal who I could depend on and I am depending on you now and I know that if I am laying down at the bottom of the ocean tonight you will see that my wishs in this letter is carried out to the letter.</p>
				<p>What I want to say is about Florrie and little Al. Now don’t think Al that I am going to ask you for financial assistants because I would know better then that and besides we don’t need it on acct. of me having $10000 dollars soldier insurence in Florrie’s name as the benefitter and the way she is coining money in that beauty parlor she won’t need to touch my insurence but save it for little Al for a rainy day only I suppose that the minute she gets her hands on it she will blow it for widows weeds and I bet they will be some weeds Al and everybody will think they are flowers instead of weeds.</p>
				<p>But what I am getting at is that she won’t need no money because with what I leave her and what she can make she has got enough and more then enough but I often say that money isn’t the only thing in this world and they’s a whole lot of things pretty near as good and one of them is kindness and what I am asking from you and Bertha is to drop in on her once in a while up in Chi and pay her a visit and I have all ready wrote her a letter telling her to ask you but even if she don’t ask you go and see her any way and see how she is getting along and if she is takeing good care of the kid or leaving him with the Swede nurse all the while.</p>
				<p>Between you and I Al what I am scared of most is that Florrie’s mind will be effected if anything happens to me and without knowing what she was doing she would probably take the first man that asked her and believe me she is not the kind that would have to wait around on no st. corner to catch somebody’s eye but they would follow her around and nag at her till she married them and I would feel like he‑⁠ll over it because Florrie is the kind of a girl that has got to be handled right and not only that but what would become of little Al with some horse <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> for a father in law and probably this bird would treat him like a dog and beat him up either that or make a sissy out of him.</p>
				<p>Well Al old pal I know you will do like I ask and go and see her and maybe you better go alone but if you do take Bertha along I guess it would be better and not let Bertha say nothing to her because Florrie is the kind that flare up easy and specially when they think they are a little better then somebody. But if you could just drop her a hint and say that she should ought to be proud to be a widow to a husband that died for Uncle Sam and she ought to live for my memory and for little Al and try and make him as much like I as possible I believe it would make her think and any way I want you to do it for me old pal.</p>
				<p>Well good by old pal and I wished I could leave some thing to you and Bertha and believe me I would if I had ever known this was comeing off this way though of course I figured right along that I wouldn’t last long in France because what chance has a corporal got? But I figured I would make some arrangements for a little present for you and Bertha as soon as I got to France but of course it looks now like I wouldn’t never get there and all the money I have got is tied up so its to late to think of that and all as I can say is good luck to you and Bertha and everybody in Bedford and I hope they will be proud of me and remember I done my best and I often say what more can a man do then that?</p>
				<p>Well Al I will say good by again and good luck and now have got to quit and go to chow.</p>

					<p epub:type="se:letter.dateline">On the Ship Board, <abbr>Jan.</abbr> 24.</p>
				</header>
				<p><b epub:type="z3998:salutation">Friend Al</b>: Well this has been some day and wait till you hear about it and hear what come off and some of the birds on this ship took me for a sucker and tried to make a rummy out of me but I was wise to their game and I guess the shoe is on the other foot this time.</p>
				<p>Well it was early this <abbr class="time-of-day">a.m.</abbr>. and I couldn’t sleep and I was up on deck and along come one of them French officers that’s been on board all the way over. Well I thought I would try myself out on him like Lee said he done so I give him a salute and I said to him “Schones tag nicht wahr.” Like you would say its a beautiful day only I thought I was saying it in French but wait till you hear about it Al.</p>
				<p>Well Al they ain’t nobody in the world fast enough to of caught what he said back to me and I won’t never know what he said but I won’t never forget how he looked at me and when I took one look at him I seen we wasn’t going to get along very good so I turned around and started up the deck. Well he must of flagged the first man he seen and sent him after me and it was a 2nd. lieut. and he come running up to me and stopped me and asked me what was my name and what <abbr>Co.</abbr> and <abbr>etc.</abbr> and at first I was going to stall and then I thought I better not so I told him who I was and he left me go.</p>
				<p>Well I didn’t know then what was comeing off so I just layed low and I didn’t have to wait around long and all of a sudden a bird from the Colonel’s staff found me in the parlor and says I was wanted right away and when I got to this room there was the <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Col.</abbr> and the two Frenchmans and my captain <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Capt.</abbr> Seeley and a couple others so I saluted and I can’t tell you exactly what come off because I can’t remember all what the Colonel said but it was something like this.</p>
				<p>In the first place he says “Corporal Keefe they’s some little matters that you have got to explain and we was going to pass them up first on the grounds that <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Capt.</abbr> Seeley said you probably didn’t know no better but this thing that come off this <abbr class="time-of-day">a.m.</abbr>. can’t be explained by ignorants.”</p>
				<p>So then he says “It was reported that you was standing on deck the night before last and you made the remark that we had a he‑⁠ll of a censor ship.” And he says “What did you mean by that?”</p>
				<p>So you see Al this smart alex of a Lee had told me they called the first ship the censor ship and I believed him at first because I was thinking about something else or of course I never would of believed him because the censor ship isn’t no ship like this kind of a ship but means something else. So I explained about that and I seen <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Capt.</abbr> Seeley kind of crack a smile so then I knew I was OK</p>
				<p>So then he pulled it on me about speaking to <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Capt.</abbr> Somebody of the French army in the German language and of course they was only one answer to that and you see the way it was Al all the time Smith was pretending to learn us French he was learning us German and Lee put him up to it but when the Colonel asked me what I meant by doing such a thing as talk German why of course I knew in a minute that they had been trying to kid me but at first I told the Colonel I couldn’t of said no German because I don’t know no more German than Silk O’Loughlin. Well the Frenchman was pretty sore and I don’t know what would of came off only for <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Capt.</abbr> Seeley and he spoke up and said to the Colonel that if he could have a few minutes to investigate he thought he could clear things up because he figured I hadn’t intended to do nothing wrong and somebody had probably been playing jokes.</p>
				<p>So <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Capt.</abbr> Seeley went out and it seemed like a couple of yrs. till he came back and he had Smith and Lee and Doran with him. So then them 3 birds was up on the carpet and I’ll say they got some panning and when it was all over the Colonel said something about they being a dam site to much kidding back and fourth going on and he hoped that before long we would find out that this war wasn’t no practicle joke and he give Lee and Smith a fierce balling out and he said he would leave <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Capt.</abbr> Seeley to deal with them and he would report Doran to the proper quarters and then he was back on me again and he said it looked like I had been the innocent victim of a practicle joke but he says “You are so dam innocent that I figure you are temperately unfit to hold on to a corporal’s warrant so you can consider yourself reduced to the ranks. We can’t have no corporals that if some comedian told them the Germans was now one of our allies they would try and get in the German trenches and shake hands with them.”</p>
				<p>Well Al when it was all over I couldn’t hardly keep from laughing because you see I come out of it OK and the laugh was on Smith and Lee and Doran because I got just what I wanted because I never did want to be a corporal because it meant I couldn’t pal around with the boys and be their pals and I never felt right when I was giveing them orders because I would rather be just one of them and make them feel like we were all equals.</p>
				<p>Of course they wasn’t no time on the whole trip when Lee or Doran or Smith either one of them had me fooled because just to look at them you would know they are the kind of smart alex that’s always trying to put something over on somebody only I figured two could play at that game as good as one and I would kid them right back and give them as good as they sent because I always figure that the game ain’t over till the ninth inning and the man that does the laughing then has got all the best of it. But at that I don’t bear no bad will towards neither one of them and I have got a good notion to ask <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Capt.</abbr> Seeley to let them off easy.</p>
				<p>Well Al this is a long letter but I wanted you to know I wasn’t no corporal no more and if a sub hits us now Al I can hop into a boat as quick as I feel like it but jokeing a side if something like that happened it wouldn’t make no difference to me if I was a corporal or not a corporal because I am a man and I would do my best and help the rest of the boys get into the boats before I thought about myself.</p>

				<p><b epub:type="z3998:salutation">Friend Al</b>: Well old pal just a line to let you know we are out of the danger zone and pretty near in port and I can’t tell you where we land at but everybody is hollering and the band’s playing and I guess the boys feels a whole lot better then when we was out there where the subs could get at us but between you and I Al I never thought about the subs all the way over only when I heard somebody else talk about them because I always figure that if they’s some danger of that kind the best way to do is just forget it and if its going to happen all right but what’s the use of worrying about it? But I suppose lots of people is built different and they have just got to worry all the while and they get scared stiff just thinking about what might happen but I always say nobody ever got fat worrying so why not just forget it and take things as they come.</p>
				<p>Well old pal they’s to many sights to see so I will quit for this time.</p>

				</header>
				<p><b epub:type="z3998:salutation">Friend Al</b>: Well old pal here we are and its against the rules to tell you where we are at but of course it don’t take no Shylock to find out because all you would have to do is look at the post mark that they will put on this letter.</p>
				<p>Any way you couldn’t pronounce what the town’s name is if you seen it spelled out because it isn’t nothing like how its spelled out and you won’t catch me trying to pronounce none of these names or talk French because I am off of languages for a while and good old American is good enough for me eh Al?</p>
				<p>Well Al now that its all over I guess we was pretty lucky to get across the old pond without no trouble because between you and I Al I heard just a little while ago from one of the boys that three nights ago we was attacked and our ship just missed getting hit by a periscope and the destroyers went after the subs and they was a whole flock of them and the reason we didn’t hear nothing is that the death bombs don’t go off till they are way under water so you can’t hear them but between you and I Al the navy men say they was nine subs sank.</p>
				<p>Well I didn’t say nothing about it to the man who tipped me off but I had a hunch that night that something was going on and I don’t remember now if it was something I heard or what it was but I knew they was something in the air and I was expecting every minute that the signal would come for us to take to the boats but they wasn’t no necessity of that because the destroyers worked so fast and besides they say they don’t never give no alarm till the last minute because they don’t want to get everybody up at night for nothing.</p>
				<p>Well any way its all over now and here we are and you ought to of heard the people in the town here cheer us when we come in and you ought to see how the girls look at us and believe me Al they are some girls. Its a good thing I am an old married man or I believe I would pretty near be tempted to flirt back with some of the ones that’s been trying to get my eye but the way it is I just give them a smile and pass on and they’s no harm in that and I figure a man always ought to give other people as much pleasure as you can as long as it don’t harm nobody.</p>
				<p>Well Al everybody’s busier then a chicken with their head off and I haven’t got no more time to write. But when we get to where we are going I will have time maybe and tell you how we are getting along and if you want drop me a line and I wish you would send me the Chi papers once in a while especially when the baseball training trips starts but maybe they won’t be no Jack Keefe to send them to by that time but if they do get me I will die fighting. You know me Al.</p>
